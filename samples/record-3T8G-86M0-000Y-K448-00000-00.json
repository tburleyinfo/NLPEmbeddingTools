Kinshasa's people lined the streets to welcome the rebels and the end of Mobutu Sese Seko's three-decade dictatorship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By midday, rebels had taken over the Voice of Zaire radio station near Kinshasa's center. Rebel soldiers armed with mounted machine guns stood guard outside the radio station, where hundreds of residents gathered, wearing white headbands to show their support for the rebels.</p><p>Civilians ran jubilantly through the streets, waving palm fronds and flashing victory signs with their fingers. \"Mobutu has gone crazy! We want Kabila!\" they cried.</p><p>Mobutu abandoned Kinshasa on Friday and passed control of the country to his Cabinet. Aides said the cancer-stricken president was flying to his northern hometown of Gbadolite, 700 miles away, for a few days' \"rest.\" His exact whereabouts and plans were unclear.</p><p>Mobutu's handpicked prime minister, Gen. Likulia Bolongo, vowed to remain in power \"until the end,\" but urged government troops to remain in their camps - and then slipped out of the country himself.</p><p>The rebels ordered government troops to surrender their arms by midday. Kabila said he expected his 10,000 fighters to take full control of the capital in \"a matter of hours.\"</p><p>The rebel fighters have faced little opposition from Mobutu's ill-equipped and poorly trained solders during their eight-month advance across the country, and there were no signs of resistance today.</p><p>Zairian soldiers were retreating from downtown Kinshasa ahead of the rebel advance, one of the military sources said on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Rebels were well past the international airport and therefore apparently in control of the airfield itself, the source said. About 1,500 rebels were reported to be at a second, cargo airport near central Kinshasa.</p><p>People lined the road to the airport to welcome the rebel advance.</p><p>\"Don't call them rebels, call them liberators!\" one Kinshasan cried.</p><p>Miguel Kamputu, 18, rolled on his back on a filthy sidewalk, shouting, \"Oh, Kabila! Oh, Kabila!\" then shaking with laughter.</p><p>\"Too much suffering. Too much suffering. He is finally here,\" he said.</p><p>Civilians carrying automatic weapons monitored Mobutu's soldiers to ensure they did not loot or attack foreigners, as troops have done in other cities.</p><p>\"We want to keep this area safe to guard the businesses and protect foreigners, stop looting so everything is normal,\" one AK-47-toting resident, John Makwala, told The Associated Press.</p><p>An estimated 300 Americans were in Kinshasa and U.S. troops were ready to begin an evacuation if they are ordered to do so, Navy Cmdr. Bob Anderson said. About 100 Marines and six aircraft are stationed in Brazzaville, Congo, across the Zaire River from Kinshasa.</p><p>\"We've pulled a little bit of our force forward,\" he said.</p><p>As the rebel advance became apparent, confusion erupted in the capital, with some troops fleeing and civilians picking up and firing abandoned weapons.</p><p>One civilian strode down the street, cigarette dangling from his lip and a grenade launcher swinging on his hip.</p><p>A crowd walking toward central Kinshasa waved white handkerchiefs as they encountered about 25 Zairian troops. The soldiers fired into the air, then left. Two people were killed, but it was unclear how they died.</p><p>Kabila, speaking from the southeastern city of Lubumbashi, appealed for calm and said he would form a transitional government by Tuesday and a new constitution within 60 days.</p><p>The rebel leader said he was taking over in Zaire to avoid a power vacuum and more bloodshed. Kabila said he \"will assume from now the functions of head of state.\"</p><p>Kabila said today he had spoken to Zairian army generals in Kinshasa and they were \"ready to receive orders from me.\"</p><p>\"I am happy, very happy to succeed,\" Kabila said with a beaming smile.</p><p>Witnesses said the head of the presidential guard, Gen. Nzimbi Ngbale, fled by boat to Brazzaville just hours after Mobutu's departure.</p><p>The presidential guard, which numbers about 3,000, was the main enforcement tool during Mobutu's iron-fisted rule, and it had been seen as the only united force likely to fight in his defense. The tens of thousands of regular soldiers have either fled or joined the rebels.</p><p>Western military sources said army chief Gen. Marc Mahele Lieko Bokungu - one of the top generals who had advised Mobutu on Thursday that troops would not defend the capital and that he should leave - was killed about midnight Friday by a Zairian soldier.</p><p>One of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said today the general was shot as a traitor.</p><p>Prime Minister Likulia said in a radio broadcast today that he would continue his mission \"to the end.\" But within an hour, a Western diplomat said that the premier - a four-star general who rarely made appearances without his full dress uniform - had slipped across the river to Brazzaville.</p><p>The 66-year-old Mobutu, who has prostate cancer, was expected to seek exile in Morocco, diplomatic sources said.</p><p>On Friday, his information minister read a statement saying that Mobutu retained the title of president but relinquished all power over the handling of state affairs to his government.</p><p>Mobutu's apparent abdication followed months of cajoling by his former allies, including the United States, which had seen his departure as the best way to ensure a transition of power without further bloodshed.</p><p>Kabila has promised to undo the damage wrought by Mobutu's nearly 32 years in power - to restore order and integrity and hold democratic elections. But he has been short on specifics, and his troops have been accused of atrocities against refugees.</p><p>In a victory speech, Kabila said Mobutu no longer concerned him.</p><p>\"He can stay in his village, but I think it is not very important at all,\" Kabila said.</p><p>Mobutu's Cabinet members were advised to continue in their posts and \"await instructions from the alliance.\" Kabila urged calm in Kinshasa, and warned that anyone who harms Zairians or foreigners would be \"severely sanctioned.\"</p><p>Rebel leaders demanded the government's unconditional surrender.</p><p>\"We ask our population in all the country - specifically in Kinshasa - to stay in their houses, to be calm and not to do anything to jeopardize the situation in Kinshasa,\" rebel Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha said.</p><p>There were rumors that Mobutu's son, Capt. Mobutu Kongulu, had fled to Brazzaville. A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the younger Mobutu had shipped his family across the river.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-86M0-000Y-K448-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 17, 1997, Saturday, PM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
