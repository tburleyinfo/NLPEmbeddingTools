Talks must be held to stop violence but the government wants the violence to continue in order to hold onto power, he said. Following is the text of a report and interview by Zairean rebel radio from Bukavu on 23rd November</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Goma-Bukavu road will very soon be open for movement after the clearing of a few hidden shooters, who are in disarray. This is a quote from the declaration made on Friday [22nd November] to the international press by the president of the Alliance of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire [ADFLCZ], Laurent-Desire Kabila. The plan is possible thanks to the victory of the alliance forces over the coalition of the Zairean Armed Forces [FAZ] and the FAR [former Rwandan Armed Forces], the alliance president stressed.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>Source: Radio of the People, Bukavu, in French 1500 gmt 23 Nov 96</p></bodyText></section><p>He also referred to Thursday's [21st November] fighting on the Walikale-Lubutu road, during which elements of the Zairean Armed Forces supported by FAR abandoned a fair quantity of heavy weapons and ammunition following their defeat. According to President Kabila, his forces were able to free 67,000 Zairean civilians taken as hostage and used as human shields by the Interahamwe [Rwandan Hutu militias] in Mugunga, Sake, Tango and Kibumba. He also announced the opening of a humanitarian corridor under the control of the alliance forces on the Minova-Goma-Gisenyi line.</p><p>He also recalled the conclusions reached by the various missions sent to Goma and Bukavu on the subject of the nonexistence of Rwandan refugees on the liberated territory. The international community, particularly the French, therefore have no reason to be involved in a problem which has already been solved by separating the intimidators from the genuine refugees, who have gone home en masse. Laurent Kabila believes that France is trying to support the Kinshasa regime instead of actively contributing towards the construction of the country with the support of the ADFLCZ.</p><p>Following yesterday's [22nd November] visit to Sayo [phonetic] camp, where impressive quantities of arms and ammunition captured from FAZ and FAR had been stockpiled, Kabila confirmed the alliance's position, saying that the international forces could only come to Bukavu and Goma subject to authorization by the alliance. It is worth recalling that the visit of Sayo camp and the sizeable arms stockpile was conducted by Kabila for the international press who had met in Bukavu for that purpose.</p><p>Here is Mr Kabila on the microphone of Mabele Mwana Kitoko [phonetic]:</p><p>[Kabila] That is our objective. We are going there, we are going there [repetition as heard] [words indistinct] because that is not their place. They must step aside. [Words indistinct].</p><p>[Mabele] Mr Kabila, it is said that there are great projects planned for the region, notably from Americans who would like to replace the French, and that you could be a man for the Americans. What do you say to that?</p><p>[A] They have never contacted me. I do not know. They have not contacted me. I am nobody's man. I am a man of my people. Who will replace France if it loses influence in the region? Why it is going to lose influence? Well, what I do know is that the Congolese [Zairean] people have no influence in France.</p><p>[Q] We will talk to you in terms of representatives of great powers. I am talking in terms of aid, cooperation, financial aid -</p><p>[Kabila, interrupting] And why [words indistinct] of France? It is because it is allied to the devil. That is natural. That must stop.</p><p>[Q] Nevertheless, (?there is) support for President Mobutu within his family, his ethnic group and even in the interior of Zaire. He is still popular, don't you think?</p><p>[A] Among a tiny minority. He is not popular at all. It is a tiny, insignificant minority.</p><p>[Q] However, there is indeed Zairean national pride which was hurt with what took place here in Kivu. There is talk of (?remorse) in Kinshasa -</p><p>[Kabila, interrupting] That is an interpretation. A politicized interpretation by the media, people who have an interest in supporting Mobutu, and that is all.</p><p>[Q] However, you are an exception Mr Kabila. You have a piece of Zairean territory of which you are the president [words indistinct].</p><p>[A] No, no, no, I am not a president of anything.</p><p>[Q] In any case, you do not recognize the leadership in Kinshasa.</p><p>[A] We do not recognize it, because what is the leadership in Kinshasa. It is illegal. It is not a legal leadership. It is a group of gangsters who seized power. There is no constitution. So, them and me, it is [words indistinct].</p><p>[Q] So, you have to achieve legitimacy.</p><p>[A] Well, popular legitimacy. Because all you are seeing [here] are not career soldiers. We did not recruit them, we do not pay them. It is the people with arms against an oppressive regime.</p><p>[Q] It appears as if President Mobutu would like to see you in Nice.</p><p>[A] In Nice? No, here, in Africa, not in Nice. In his chateau?</p><p>[Q] For example.</p><p>[A] Why?</p><p>[Q] And if he asked you to go and have talks with him to participate in a national unity government?</p><p>[A] It is understandable for there to be discussions with him, and that is good. That is the way we think of things. We must have talks, to stop violence. It is them who do not want to stop violence. They do not want to lose power.</p><p>[Q] If a ministerial post was proposed for you, would you accept it?</p><p>[A] Who? A ministry? I do not need it. I am not struggling for a ministry.</p><p>[Q] And if they proposed to you power-sharing in Kinshasa, would you accept?</p><p>[A] We will hold talks, one could not share power just like that [words indistinct]. Between thieves and who?</p><p>[Q] However, President Mobutu has a habit of buying his opponents?</p><p>[A] But he has never bought me. That is not possible.</p><p>[Q] Can you be bought?</p><p>[A] I cannot be bought.</p><p>[Q] He is very rich. He is said to have a colossal fortune in Switzerland.</p><p>[A] That is what people say. And that is why we are fighting him. That wealth has been stolen from the people. He must hand back everything to the people. Nothing belongs to him. He cannot even give a reason why he is a billionaire while people are living in misery here. You have seen the state of the country. Not even one road exists. Not even those that existed during the colonial time. So, what does Mr Mobutu represent to the people? Absolutely nothing. He is an oppressor, a slave trader.</p><p>[Q] Some opponents in Kinshasa say that you are not even of Zairean nationality.</p><p>[A] Well, I am from the centre of central Zaire. Everybody knows that well. [Words indistinct] It is Mobutu who is suspected of being a stranger who comes from Central Africa. You know Gbadolite, you have been there?</p><p>[Mabele] Yes.</p><p>[Kabila] That is it. Mobayi-Mbongo, just 20 km from River Bangui. And on the other side there is Bangui - on the other side is the Central African Republic. He himself used to say that he originated from - how do we call them? - from Mobaye, on the other side. There is another [words indistinct]. From Banzyville [former name of Mobayi-Mbongo]. Banzyville is in the Central African Republic, on the shores of the River Bangui. He comes from there.</p><p>[Q] Mr Kabila, before entering into politics, you yourself were a businessman, I think.</p><p>[A] I have never been a businessman. I have never been a businessman.</p><p>[Q] What were your activities? I was told that you were a gold dealer .</p><p>[A] Who said that?</p><p>[Q] I was told, you know, rumours [words indistinct].</p><p>[A] [Words indistinct]. Abuses. These are abuses.</p><p>[Q] What were you doing, Mr Kabila?</p><p>[A] I have been involved in politics for many years. I have always opposed the successive coup d'etats carried out by Mobutu since my youth, because I was in the youth movement of a party which took power through electoral votes, universal suffrage. And it is Mobutu who overthrow it. So, people had to [word indistinct] to the means he used to try to stop him. Just come and see them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCSWB1996</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3S4Y-DSG0-0017-G40J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10962</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1336\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>BBC Summary of World Broadcasts</publicationName><copyright>KANSAS ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE SERVICEKANSAS ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE SERVICE#THE#STATE#OF#KANSAS#</copyright><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>November 26, 1996, Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001456</classCode><className>REBELLIONS &amp; INSURGENCIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001289</classCode><className>PARAMILITARY &amp; MILITIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000868</classCode><className>HOSTAGE TAKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001141</classCode><className>MILITARY WEAPONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001141</classCode><className>MILITARY WEAPONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX357</classCode><className>KINSHASA, CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GR213</classCode><className>MIDWEST USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC554</classCode><className>RWANDA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC394</classCode><className>CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR114</classCode><className>CARIBBEAN ISLANDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GR118</classCode><className>LATIN AMERICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
