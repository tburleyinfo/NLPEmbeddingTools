Albanese said that Kabila was the \" champion of a number of vested interests linked with the English-speaking world\" and was supported by technology made available by the United States and Britain. Kabila's plan, Albanese continued, was to expand throughout the Great Lakes region, acting not only on his own behalf but on that of Uganda and Rwanda. The \" elimination\" of the Hutu refugees was one of the \"favours\" Kabila was able to offer to Rwandan Vice-President and Defence Minister Paul Kagame. The following is the text of an interview with Albanese by Marco Tosatti in Vatican City, published by Italian newspaper 'La Stampa' on 5th May:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Vatican City: In the Vatican the good news from the ship Outeniqua was received with satisfaction and a good pinch of scepticism. We spoke to Father Giulio Albanese, a Combonian missionary with much experience of the Great Lakes region, who is currently in Rome.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[Tosatti] Can we believe the agreement reached and Kabila's promise to halt his men?</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>Source: 'La Stampa' (Internet version), Turin, in Italian 5 May 97</p></bodyText></section><p>[Albanese] I spoke just now to Kinshasa and, according to diplomatic circles, Kabila will halt his men only after the meeting to be held on board the Outeniqua in six to ten days'time, when the situation should basically be defined at last. There should be a transitional government to ensure the move towards an election.</p><p>[Q] Will Kabila honour the assurances he gave [South African President] Mandela about a democratic transition?</p><p>[A] The opposition in Kinshasa is afraid that once Kabila has taken power and occupied the city he will say: Yes, we will hold a free election, but only when the country is ready. It is feared that there will be a repetition of what [Ugandan President] Yoweri Museveni did when he seized Kampala in 1986. This is because Kabila is following to the letter everything that Museveni has taught him.</p><p>[Q] Who is behind Kabila?</p><p>[A] I am convinced that Kabila has become the herald, the champion of a number of vested interests linked with the English-speaking world - not necessarily of US extraction only, but including them. There certainly are a number of joint ventures which have signed contracts with Kabila - joint ventures connected to the South African De Beers (diamond) company, but which extend well beyond South Africa. It is they who invented \"Executive Outcomes\" , though they have never admitted it - the mercenary agency that has become notorious in Africa in recent years. It is they who supported [UNITA leader Jonas] Savimbi against [Angolan President] Dos Santos in Angola.</p><p>[Q] But will a democratic Zaire be possible after Mobutu?</p><p>[A] I am very confused about the scenarios. Kabila is a very astute man and he is revealing political qualities that I would never have imagined him to have. But I do not know whether it is he who holds the reins, who is steering the ship. One thing is certain: Kabila is linked to the Simba war of 1964 and to drug trafficking. He is someone who has been involved in all sorts of dirty business: I am very sceptical about his having converted now, about his supporting a democratic platformâ€¦ [Newspaper ellipsis] But miracles are possible.</p><p>[Q] But what was the reason for the massacre of the refugees?</p><p>[A] Kabila is executing a plan to expand throughout the Great Lakes region on behalf of the Kagame-Kabila-Museveni triumvirate. The war in Zaire was not fought by the Banyamulenge. The Banyamulenge army consists of 2,000 men. A mere 2,000 men could not have done all that was done.</p><p>Kabila has been able to do what he has done because he had behind him Uganda, Rwanda and a whole technology made available to him by other powers, including the United States and Britain. Kabila, who is a very tough cookie, did Kagame some favours: in other words, the elimination of these Rwandan Hutu refugees in the forests of eastern Zaire.</p><p>[Q] How many were killed?</p><p>[A] According to my calculations, some 400,000. True, they included some fighters, but the fact is that it was mainly hundreds of thousands of innocent people who paid the price. Kabila is guilty of this bloodshed; I have no doubt of that. He went along with the strategy imposed by his allies, both open and concealed, and he is not even a Banyamulenge - he is a Luba.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCSWB1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3SP2-92B0-006F-X122-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10962</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>BBC Summary of World Broadcasts</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 British Broadcasting Corporation</copyright><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 7, 1997, Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A0RH</classCode><className>CATHOLICS &amp;
