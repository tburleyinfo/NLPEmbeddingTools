No 1 radio broadcast a statement from Gen. Guillaume Mulele, described as commander of rebel forces in western Zaire, saying the rebels are \"already present in Kinshasa, and the western front is urging all foreigners and chanceries (diplomats) to leave the town as soon as they hear this message.\"</p><p>The new prime minister, Gen. Likulia Bolongo, went to the presidential palace in Kinshasa today in full military uniform to meet with Mobutu but made no comments to reporters. Likulia also plans to meet later in the day with the U.S. ambassador, Daniel Simpson.</p><p>Kinshasa, in western Zaire, is the only major city still under Mobutu's control. And Mobutu's hold on power appeared to crumble further Wednesday, after his decision to oust popular opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi from the post of prime minister sparked riots in the capital.</p><p>The United States has urged Mobutu, 66 and ill with prostate cancer, to make way for a democratic government. White House spokesman Mike McCurry on Wednesday called Mobutu's three-decade dictatorship \"a creature of history.\"</p><p>Kabila, meeting with journalists early today in the Goma palace that once belonged to Mobutu, welcomed the U.S. statement.</p><p>\"Everybody knows that this is the time for Mr. Mobutu to get out of power,\" Kabila said.</p><p>He added that the rebels had no indication Mobutu plans to resign, though Kabila repeated demands he do so before any cease-fire. Mobutu would be allowed to return to his home village, the northern town of Gbadolite, but Kabila has said he would not be permitted a role in politics.</p><p>Belgium aligned itself with the United States today, declaring that Mobutu has no political future and calling his new government a military dictatorship. Foreign Minister Erik Derycke urged U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun to broker a transitional government until elections can be held.</p><p>Mobutu named Likulia, a former defense minister and army chief of staff, as prime minister Wednesday. The four-star general immediately promised a crackdown on civil liberties, saying his primary goal was \"the restoration of public order.\"</p><p>Likulia also said measures would be taken against the media for any articles that \"affected the morale of the military.\"</p><p>Several foreign journalists, including an Associated Press photographer and APTV cameraman, were beaten and had their cameras seized Wednesday by soldiers during an anti-government demonstration in Kinshasa.</p><p>Kabila said Mobutu's ouster of Tshisekedi was a desperate act to cling to power after the rebels' latest victory - winning the copper- and cobalt-rich city of Lubumbashi, 950 miles southeast of Kinshasa.</p><p>The city fell Wednesday morning, Kabila said, although fierce fighting between rebel troops and an elite group of Zairian forces continued on its outskirts.</p><p>With Lubumbashi's fall, the rebels control the second- and third-largest cities - they took No. 3 Kisangani nearly a month ago - and Zaire's top sources of income. Minerals pulled from the rich soil near Lubumbashi provide about 80 percent of Zaire's $ 300 million in annual export earnings. The rebels also captured the diamond center of Mbuji-Mayi last Friday.</p><p>Kabila said appointing Tshisekedi - the popular opposition leader - as prime minister last week was a failed attempt by Mobutu to play the opposition in Kinshasa off the rebel movement in eastern Zaire.</p><p>\"Everyone sees there is chaos in Kinshasa,\" Kabila said, adding that Tshisekedi \"fell into the net of Mr. Mobutu and now he is kicked out.\"</p><p>That does not mean, however, that the rebels have ruled out future cooperation with Tshisekedi, whom Kabila called on to \"return to our camp where we can receive him.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-8NH0-000Y-K1M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>April 10, 1997, Thursday, PM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
