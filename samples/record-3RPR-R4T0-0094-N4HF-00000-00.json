That was, however, not a formal ceasefire, noted Mandela, who chaired the meeting.</p><p>Mobutu had proposed a ceasefire, according to the communique. The proposed transitional government should organise democratic elections in Zaire, Mobutu also said adding that he would resign only after the election of a new president.</p><p> Mobutu had boarded the SAS Outeniqua Sunday and met Kabila at the negotiating table for the first time, ending two days of on-off specukation about the talks.</p><p>South African sources had earlier said there had been a proposal for Kabila to head an interim government along with a member of the Zairean opposition, possibly Etienne Chisekedi.</p><p> Chisekedi had been appointed prime minister by Mobutu in April, but was dismissed three days later because he wanted to include in his government members of Kabila's rebel movement.</p><p> Kabila's rebels claimed early Sunday to be continuing their advance on Kinshasa. Latest towns to fall were Mayamba and Bankana, leaving the rebels - who already control three-quarters of the vast nation - just 160 kilometres from the capital.</p><p> The rebels' claim, made over their Voice of the People radio, also said the advance was continuing on Mobutu's luxurious jungle residence on the northern border with the Cnetral African Republic.</p><p> The radio stressed that the advance was continuing irrespective of what happened at the Kabila-Mobutu meeting, and that \"there can be no question of a ceasefire\".</p><p> Aid workers meanwhile said the repatriation by air to Rwanda of mainly Hutu refugees from areas of eastern Zaire would continue despite heavy rain. So far 4,000 had been flown home.</p><p> A spokesman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Paul Stromberg, said that after initial protests the UNHCR now thought it would be possible to comply with rebel demands that the repatriation of some 80,000 Hutus be completed by end of June.</p><p> On Saturday alone, he said, about 1,000 had been repatriated. But he cautioned that only about half of the estimated 80,000 who fled refugee camps two weeks ago in the face of armed rebel attacks had found their way out of the jungle to assembly camps.</p><p> The meeting between Kabila and Mobutu was originally planned for Friday. However, Kabila failed to turn up, saying he was concerned about talks security and demanding the United States be excluded.</p><p> For a time Saturday it was unclear whether talks would ever come about after Kabila snubbed Mobutu Friday, refusing to fly to the ship by helicopter from Luanda while Mobutu and Mandela were on board.</p><p> Rebel spokesmen in Paris gave yet another explanation Saturday for Kabila's non-attendance. In a statement to a French news agency, they said Mobutu's delegation included witchdoctors and hypnotists who had been assigned to cast spells on Kabila.</p><p> On Friday, Mobutu's ill health caused almost five hours of delay because he could not climb the 31 metal steps to get aboard the ship.  The problem was finally solved by lowering a make-shift ramp over which he was driven by car on board the vessel.</p><p> According to Zaire's Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda, doctors had advised the cancer-stricken Mobutu against arriving by helicopter as originally planned because the vibrations would be bad for him.</p><p> The talks between Kabila and Mobutu are seen as the last chance to end the seven-month civil war without any further bloodshed as the rebels close in on Kinshasa. dpa pt</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPA1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3RPR-R4T0-0094-N4HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144245</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><timeReceived>BC CycleÂ  15:57 Central European Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Deutsche Presse-Agentur</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Deutsche Presse-Agentur</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 4, 1997, Sunday,</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
