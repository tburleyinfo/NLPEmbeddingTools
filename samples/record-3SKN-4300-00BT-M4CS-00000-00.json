''What happened today was not a change of regime through ambition, glory or anything else.''</p><p>''What happened today was an action of salvation,'' he said.</p><p>Western leaders condemned the coup, fearing it could bring on ethnic warfare on the scale of neighboring Rwanda's genocide, but said nothing about sending troops to restore President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who headed a Tutsi-Hutu coalition government.</p><p>Soldiers and police patrolled the central African nation's capital, deserted under army orders to civilians to close businesses and stay at home. Troops shut the airport, and a dozen paratroopers patrolled the state-run TV station, which was surrounded by barbed wire.</p><p>The coup follows three years of civil war between the country's Hutus and Tutsis that has killed more than 150,000 people.</p><p>The two-day-old army uprising apparently has been free of violence, although there were reports that the country's main Hutu opposition party would try to lay siege to Bujumbura and Gitega, U.N. Undersecretary-General Chinmaya Gharekhan said in New York.</p><p>Burundi's ethnic mix and hatred is similar to that of Rwanda, where Hutu militia slaughtered a half-million Tutsis and moderate Hutus two summers ago. The Rwandan genocide was prompted in part by Hutus' fears that Tutsis would try to regain the power they held until their monarchy was overthrown in 1959.</p><p>In Burundi, however, the Tutsis have been in control since the country's independence in 1962. The military coup does not alter the balance of power; no matter who has occupied the presidency, Burundi's Tutsi-run military has always run the country.</p><p>Burundi, a mountainous country about the size of New Hampshire, lies on the northeast side of Lake Tanganyika and is bordered by Tanzania, Rwanda and Zaire.</p><p>''The politicians have failed to solve the problems, and we have decided the country cannot continue like this,'' military spokesman Lt. Col Longin Minani said Thursday.</p><p>''Buyoya is more experienced, he is democratic and most people will respect him,'' he said.</p><p>In a 10-minute address, Buyoya said his first mission as head of a transitional government will be ''to stop and quickly the massacres and all kinds of criminality that have been prevailing in Burundi for almost three years.''</p><p>Ntibantunganya, who took refuge at the U.S. ambassador's residence Tuesday night, has not resigned as leader of the country's fragile coalition government, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Judith Kaula said.</p><p>''This is not the worst-case scenario, because it's not your classic bloody coup in the middle of the night,'' she said.</p><p>At least eight other Hutus, among them three prominent politicians, sought refuge Thursday in the German ambassador's residence.</p><p>The United States condemned the coup and called on military leaders to resolve the political crisis peacefully.</p><p>''We believe now this meets anybody's definition of a coup d'etat because we've now heard directly the intentions of the coup leaders,'' State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Thursday.</p><p>U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the Organization of African Unity said the international community would not accept a Burundian government installed by force.</p><p>The Tutsi-led military should ''recognize that a coup d'etat will not solve any of Burundi's problems and is only likely to intensify violence on all sides,'' Boutros-Ghali said in a statement.</p><p>Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who has tried to broker a peace deal for Burundi, called for sanctions against the new military regime.</p><p>U.N. officials were working on two contingency plans one to provide aid if the country collapses in violence and the other to send troops to Burundi to prevent ethnic slaughter. Only Zambia, Malawi and Chad have offered soldiers, however.</p><p>Tutsi paratroopers surrounded government buildings in the capital late Tuesday, forcing Ntibantunganya (pronounced En-tee-bahn-toon-gan-yah) to flee the palace.</p><p>Buyoya, who overthrew Jean-Baptiste Bagaza in a 1987 coup, paved the way for Burundi's first free elections. He was defeated in June 1993 by Melchior Ndadaye, who became the nation's first Hutu president.</p><p>Before Thursday's announcement of Burundi's new president, thousands of youths demonstrated against Buyoya, whom they accuse of fostering political dissent in Burundi. ''Buyoya is the father of disorder,'' one banner said.</p><p>In Bujumbura, a radio broadcast told people to go home. Military checkpoints were set up on main roads, cutting off the airport, university and suburbs. Streets quickly emptied except for troops and a few playing children.</p><p>On Burundi Radio, Defense Minister Lt. Col. Firmin Sinzoyiheba warned any additional demonstrations would be punished severely.</p><p>''For three years, Burundi was facing a terrible situation where people were dying day after day,'' he said, referring to the ethnic violence sparked by Ndadaye's 1993 assassination by Tutsi army paratroopers four months after he took office.</p><p>Rwanda accuses the United Nations of standing aside in 1994 as Hutu troops and allied militiamen slaughtered 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL1996</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3SKN-4300-00BT-M4CS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"929\"/><timeReceived>21:31 Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1996 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>July 25, 1996;
