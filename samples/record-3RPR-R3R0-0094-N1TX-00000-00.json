Mobutu's son, Captain Mobutu Kongolu, arrived with his family by boat in Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo.</p><p>Eyewitnesses said machine-gun fire was audible in Kinshasa, population five million, but it was not clear if the shooting was from fighting between rebels and soldiers, or whether it was just shooting in the air, possibly by security forces to deter looters.</p><p> Kabila told a news conference at rebel headquarters in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi he was taking over with the approval of Zaire's armed forces commanders and the movement he leads, the ADFL, was in full control of the country as of Saturday.</p><p> Kabila added that he would set up a \"government of national salvation\" within 72 hours and declared Zaire's interim constitution was no longer in force. He said a constitutional assemby would be summoned within three months to draft a new constitution.</p><p> The rebel leader, who began his career as a Marxist opponent of Mobutu's in the 1960s, called on the Kinshasa-controlled armed forces to lay down its arms and he appealed to residents of Kinshasa to keep calm. All settlings of accounts would be punished later, he warned.</p><p> The new government would abide by its \"international obligations\", he added.</p><p> Kabila said the country would no longer be called Zaire, its name since 1971. A reversion to the name Congo gives the country its title from the colonial era, when it was called the Belgian Congo, but also encourages confusion with its neighbour Congo, once the French Congo.</p><p> Both states are named after the 4,820-kilometre-long Congo River, which was named after the Kongo ethnic group that lives near it.</p><p> Amid the turmoil in the capital it was difficult to tell who armed men on the move in the city were. French correspondents said the rebels had reached the river port area, but other reporters in the Kinshasa city centre said they had still seen no sign of the rebels.</p><p> A reporter speaking to the U.S. television channel CNN said by late morning there had been demonstrations but no appearance of rebels. A German businessman in the city said by phone he thought the rebels had not yet advanced past the airport.</p><p> Large numbers of soldiers appeared to be deserting, getting rid of their uniforms and putting on civilian dress, eyewitnesses added.  Many of the deserters were taking their assault rifles with them.</p><p> The German businessman said by telephone that looting by indisciplined soldiers had broken out. City residents have long been worried that armed ex-soldiers will help themselves to property in the hours or days before rebels establish control, or that people will kill one another during the interregnum on account of grudges.</p><p> \"You can hear shooting from automatic weapons all round the city,\" said the businessman.</p><p> \"I'm lying down on the floor for safety. The Americans have got 1,000 men on the other side of the river, but don't come and save us,\" he added bitterly, referring to U.S. forces in nearby Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo.</p><p> Asked who was doing the looting, he said: \"It's the DSP (the presidential guard) plundering the place.\"</p><p> Earlier Saturday the rebel alliance ADFL took control of Kinshasa international airport. An ADFL spokesman said that the airport, at N'djili, some 20 kilometres from Kinshasa, was captured without a fight after government forces withdrew.</p><p> Mobutu Kongolu, the son of the former president, told his troops before he fled to Brazzaville that they should not shoot at the rebels.</p><p> There was no immediate confirmation of reports that factional fighting had broken out within the presidential guard between fight- to-the-death loyalists and elements willing to capitulate to the ADFL.</p><p> Eyewitnesses said there was some shooting in the area of the Tshatshi base, a presidential guard barrack in Kinshasa. The guard is a fighting force separate from the army and designed to keep the army in check.</p><p> Diplomats said they hoped the rebels would be able to take control without a fight. They said there was no plan to evacuate foreigners at the moment, because Kinshasa was tense and the risks incalculable.</p><p> The rebels urged government forces not to put up any resistance and to display a white flag to signal their readiness to surrender.</p><p> During the night the head of the Zairean armed forces was assassinated, apparently by Mobutu loyalists in the presidential guard. Broadcast reports said that the armed forces chief of staff and minister of defence, Mahele Lieko Bokungu, was killed by troops who stormed his office on a base near Kinshasa airport.</p><p> The troops reportedly felt he had betrayed the army and had collaborated with the rebels.</p><p> Mobutu fled the capital Friday and took up residence at his palace in the northern city of Gbadolite. He was expected to take up exile in Morocco or France in the coming days.</p><p>South Africa was to send a top-level delegation Sunday to Kabila to press him to accept other parties into his transitional government, the South African news agency SAPA reported.</p><p> The panel would probably be led by Vice-President Thabo Mbeki, who spoke with Kabila on Saturday by telephone, the agency said.</p><p> A government official said there was concern that one dictatorship in Zaire could give way to another. Kabila's fashion of declaring himself head of state was more or less a coup. South Africa earlier drafted a peace plan proposing a multi-party interim government.</p><p>Germany called for an end to fighting in Zaire. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said both sides had to ensure the security of German nationals and other foreigners in Zaire. He said the country needed to make a fresh democratic start, crowned by free elections.  dpa jbp ms</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPA1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3RPR-R3R0-0094-N1TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144245</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1060\"/><timeReceived>BC Cycle  13:09 Central European Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Deutsche Presse-Agentur</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Deutsche Presse-Agentur</copyright><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 17, 1997, Saturday,</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
