Her skull bore the mark of a large head wound, possibly inflicted by a machete.</p><p>Aid workers who have begun searching for the missing thousands estimate that between 5,000 and 10,000 returned from their inhospital refuge Monday and made for the camp from where they are to be repatriated to neighbouring Rwanda.</p><p>Rebel leader Laurent Kabila has given the international community a 60-day ultimatum to repatriate all refugees from eastern Zaire, after which he would accomplish the task himself.</p><p>Relief workers believe more than 85,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees are missing after they fled their camps last week.</p><p>Both the United States and the United Nations rejected the deadline.</p><p>In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said that \"to issue an ultimatum now, particularly when the refugees are scattered, is most unhelpful.\"</p><p>He said it was \"unreasonable … and unacceptable. … We call upon Mr. Kabila to give all support by the rebel alliance to the evacuation efforts of the United Nations.\"</p><p>The UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said the 60-day deadline was \"unrealistic\" and unlikely to be met.</p><p>The assessment was also made by UN chief Kofi Annan's spokesman and the UN Security Council on the grounds that the whereabouts of up to 300,000 refugees in eastern Zaire were still not known.</p><p>Ogata told journalists after briefing the Security Council that \"repatriation would be one of the least worst options\" for the mainly Hutu refugees. However a start would be made, she said.</p><p>UN World Food Programme (WFP) spokeswoman Michele Quintaglie said in Nairobi that her agency would send a train loaded with 115 tonnes of aid to the Kisangani region later Monday.</p><p>Kabila's troops were meanwhile reportedly poised to capture Kikwit, the last major line of defense for the government which last week deployed there soldiers of the elite presidential guard (DSP).</p><p>Late Monday, a Catholic official with contacts at Idiofa, a small town 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kikwit, said the town had fallen to the rebels who had encountered no resistance. The Zairean authorities neither denied nor confirmed the report.</p><p>DSP units were sent to Kikwit partly as a defence but also to prevent looting and pillaging by soldiers of the regular army fleeing the fighting.</p><p>A rebel official said in Lubumbashi that local residents had revolted against the elite troops who fled the town, no independent confirmation was available.</p><p>The fall of Kikwit, the economic capital of Bandundu province, would mark a major victory for the rebels following their capture in April of Lubumbashi, the second largest city in Zaire.</p><p>The town, located on the main road to Kinshasa, supplies a good part of the capital with food and the rebels have vowed to take Kinshasa by \"squeezing it dry.\"</p><p>Their advance came as US pace envoy Bill Richardson arrived in Kinshasa Monday in a bid to mediate an end to the more than six-month crisis.</p><p>The US ambassador to the United Nations told reporters he would meet early Tuesday with Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, and on Wednesday with Kabila in Lubumbashi.</p><p>\"I am here to work with the leaders of Zaire to ensure a peaceful, prosperous and democratic future for the country,\" he said, calling for a negotiated settlement to the crisis in Zaire and the creation of a transitional government.</p><p>UN sources said Richardson would try to convince archrivals Mobutu and Kabila to hold face-to-face talks, while seeking to persuade Mobutu to stand down gracefully and suggesting to Kabila that he be more flexible.</p><p>burs/bb bb</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP1997 AFP1997</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><timeReceived>2821 2821</timeReceived><timeReceived>28:21 GMT gmt</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English english</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Agence France Presse presse</copyright><publicationDate month=\"04\" day=\"28\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>April 28, 1997 1997</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH english</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNITED NATIONS  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className> UNITED NATIONS </className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>  54%);</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNITED NATIONS  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className> UNITED NATIONS </className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>  54%);</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Eligibility for Refugee Status</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjFFMzM2M0FCN0QyNDM0QTgzQzQyRTkzRkVBOTg5MzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUM5ODIzNEVDM0VCNDU1OTkyMDZCRUU1Q0ZCMzM4NDM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001461</classCode><className>REFUGEES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUM5ODIzNEVDM0VCNDU1OTkyMDZCRUU1Q0ZCMzM4NDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0VDRDc0NDNBMjkwNDJBMEFCOUNGMTU1QzFBRTIyMTk</classCode><className>Refugee Status</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DHZS</classCode><className>RESETTLEMENT &amp;
