With 300,000 inhabitants, it has little industry, but made headlines in May 1995 with an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, which was finally contained.</p><p>Sources close to Laurent Kabila's rebel alliance at their base in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi said rebels were in Kikwit, but that government troops still held the airport there.</p><p>The coordinator of the Bandundu region crisis committee set up in Kikwit to prevent looting, Father Dominique Kahanga, said that rebel troops arrived on Tuesday morning after government soldiers left without a fight.</p><p>However, Zairean Information Minister Kin Key Mulumba on Tuesday said reports that Kikwit had fallen were \"pure deception\".</p><p>Rebel leaders in Lubumbashi would not confirm the reports.</p><p>If confirmed, nevertheless, the fall of Kikwit would prove a serious blow to President Mobutu Sese Seko's beleaguered regime, following the seizure of more than half the vast country to the rebels since October.</p><p>International efforts were under way Tuesday to bring about direct talks between Mobutu and Kabila.</p><p>US envoy Bill Richardson, the US ambassador to the United Nations, was set to meet Mobutu late Tuesday morning in a delicate mediation, before flying to Lubumbashi for talks with Kabila.</p><p>A US diplomat in Lubumbashi, Zaire's second city, said that Richardson will on Wednesday go to Kisangani, the third largest town, in a region where some 85,000 desperate Rwandan Hutu refugees have disappeared amid reports of fighting.</p><p>Richardson arrived in Kinshasa on Monday on a mediation mission ordered by US President Bill Clinton to bolster efforts to reach a peace agreement.</p><p>Mobutu and Kabila are expected to hold face-to-face talks this week on a South African naval vessel, which has begun sailing towards the Zairean coast in readiness, source close to negotiations said in Pretoria on Tuesday.</p><p>\"The meeting should take place before the end of the week, if they don't change their minds,\" said the source, who demanded anonymity.</p><p>South African officials and the UN-OAU special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun on April 16 said talks between the two men would take place \"very soon\" in South Africa.</p><p>However since then Mobutu, who is recovering from cancer surgery, has said he did not want to go to South Africa, citing poor health. He said he preferred French-speaking Gabon or Congo.</p><p>Western diplomatic sources have indicated that, in diplomatic terms, Richardson will urge Mobutu to quit power gracefully after 32 years of dictatorship.</p><p>Observers here however said it was unlikely that the president, who has seen his erstwhile allies in the West withdraw support one by one, will give up so easily.</p><p>Mobutu insists on the right to stand in presidential elections while Kabila, whose forces have captured more than half this huge nation, says he must resign.</p><p>UN diplomats said Richardson would try to persuade Kabila to be more flexible, and to convince both men to meet despite disagreement over a venue.</p><p>Another of his tasks is to assess the humanitarian situation in the northeast after the Rwandan Hutu refugees disappeared from their camps south of Kisangani.</p><p>Relief workers located up to 10,000 of them Monday, hungry, sick and frightened. Kabila has given the United Nations just two months to repatriate them all to Rwanda, sparking protests from western leaders and the United Nations.</p><p>\"There is a humanitarian crisis here and the international community must respond,\" Richardson acknowledged Monday.</p><p>He called for a negotiated settlement to the conflict and the formation of a transitional government to lead the country to elections.</p><p>The envoy was expected to travel to Angola, and possibly Gabon as well, US officials in Washington said Monday.</p><p>km-bur/nb/ml ml</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP1997 AFP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3TD9-38S0-0025-F4MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1627\"/><timeReceived>2912 2912</timeReceived><timeReceived>29:12 GMT gmt</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English english</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Agence France Presse presse</copyright><publicationDate month=\"04\" day=\"29\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>April 29, 1997 1997</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH english</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>UNITED NATIONS  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className> UNITED NATIONS </className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>  56%);</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>UNITED NATIONS  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className> UNITED NATIONS </className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>  56%);</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;
