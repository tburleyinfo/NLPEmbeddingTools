Some shouted ''Liberte!'' and burned the flag they associated with nearly 32 years of Mobutu's despotic rule.</p><p>There were conflicting reports on the whereabouts of Mobutu himself.</p><p>Authorities at a military airport in the Moroccan capital of Rabat said Mobutu arrived there at 3 a.m. (0300 GMT) Sunday. The entourage arrived in one civilian plane and two military planes, and immediately went to a resort hotel on the sea, just south of the Moroccan capital, the authorities said on condition of anonymity.</p><p>But a Mobutu spokesman in Paris said the deposed strongman was still in his home village of Gbadolite in northern Zaire Sunday morning. He had fled there hours before the rebels marched into the city.</p><p>At the rebel's headquarters in Lubumbashi, the rebel alliance's finance minister, Mwana Nanga Mawampanga, said a delegation headed by Deo Bugera, the group's secretary general, would arrive Sunday to set up a local government.</p><p>The finance minister said the alliance routinely sends a political delegation to newly-captured territory, ''to reassure the population, to explain our message.''</p><p>When asked when rebel leader Laurent Kabila may go to Kinshasa, the minister replied, ''Very soon. In the next couple of days, or a few days â€¦ It's at his discretion.''</p><p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the United States could work with Kabila as ''president'' of Zaire.</p><p>''Of course we're going to continue working with Mr. Kabila in his new position as we have worked with him quite regularly over the last couple of months during the civil war and the rebellion,'' Burns told the British Broadcasting Corp.</p><p>''It's a de facto recognition. There will be no need for a formal, you know, statement from the U.S. government.''</p><p>The BBC also reported that Kabila had the de facto recognition of the Organization of African Unity.</p><p>In the La Cite district near the home of popular opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi residents danced around the charred remains of seven soldiers.</p><p>Camp Tshatshi, the site of Mobutu's opulent presidential palace, was the scene of small arms battles through the night, but by morning was in fully in rebel hands.</p><p>Some people looted the houses of generals in the camp, carrying off chairs and even books stamped ''Mobutu,'' but most people trying to scavenge were shooed off by the rebels, who would not allow any access to the palace.</p><p>There was minor looting in the town overnight, with some windows smashed.</p><p>Medical staff at Kinshasa's Mama Yemo hospital named after Mobutu's mother, but neglected and bereft of supplies in the last years of his rule struggled to treat those wounded during the night's violence. They said that 11 dead had arrived during the night.</p><p>That brought to 26 the number of known dead, mostly government soldiers shot dead by residents while looting or residents killed by looting soldiers.</p><p>Just 60 worshipers trickled into to the 9:30 a.m. (0830GMT) mass at St. Anne, a Roman Catholic Church in downtown Kinshasa, far fewer than usual.</p><p>''We should ask our Lord to inhabit the hearts of those who will rule our country,'' the priest said in his opening prayer.</p><p>Saturday night, rebels in Zaire sent their first radio broadcast from the newly captured Voice of Zaire, ordering former government soldiers to turn in their weapons by Sunday, and warning looters they would be punished.</p><p>Aides to Mobutu either fled or died at the hands of their own soldiers.</p><p>Dozens of Mobutu associates sought refuge from reprisal attacks in the plush InterContinental Hotel, arriving with bags packed and trickling out during the day to flee in speedboats across the river into neighboring Congo.</p><p>They included Mobutu's son, Kongulu, a senior army officer who escaped with his family and 30 bodyguards.</p><p>Not all were so lucky. Mobutu's army chief and defense minister, Gen. Marc Mahele Lieko Bokungu, was shot by a soldier who accused him of being a traitor for advising Mobutu that Kinshasa was indefensible, and that he should leave.</p><p>Kabila was visibly pleased. ''I am happy, very happy to succeed,'' he said with a broad smile after proclaiming himself president at rebel headquarters in Lubumbashi.</p><p>The 56-year-old rebel leader pledged to form a transitional government by Tuesday and issue a new constitution within 60 days.  But he made no mention of elections the United States has pressed him to organize.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3RY4-5M00-00BT-M3MW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><timeReceived>07:59 Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated PressÂ  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 18, 1997;
