Mediators fear the talks were the last chance to secure a truce and prevent the rebels from marching on Zaire's capital, Kinshasa. All indications were that the rebels intend to keep advancing.</p><p>U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun told reporters that Mobutu proposed a cease-fire and a transitional government to prepare the Central African nation for its first multiparty elections. Mobutu said he would hand over power to an elected authority, though he has never ruled out running himself.</p><p>But rebel leader Laurent Kabila, according to the statement read by Sahnoun, demanded that the rebels be allowed to take power as the transitional authority and that Mobutu cede power to them.</p><p>Sahnoun said there was ''some tension from both sides'' at the start of Sunday's talks. ''But then there was a cordial tone, very African. There were no poisonous remarks.''</p><p>Kabila agreed to a temporary cease-fire before the meeting, according to Sahnoun, but it was not clear later whether the truce continued or that it ever had taken place.</p><p>''As a gesture of good will he has ordered his troops to stop their advance on all fronts,'' Sahnoun said, reading a statement.  ''They would, however, defend themselves and reciprocate if they were attacked.''</p><p>Kabila's forces claimed Saturday to have taken control of Kenge, the last major town on the way to Kinshasa, only 185 kilometers (115 miles) to the west. Rebels also took Lisala, Mobutu's birthplace, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of the president's hometown of Gbadolite, a rebel officer said.</p><p>During a news conference with a grim-faced Mobutu and smiling Kabila, Sahnoun told reporters aboard the naval ship docked in this port city that South African President Nelson Mandela, who was helping mediate the talks, would convene another meeting between the two men in six to 10 days.</p><p>Mandela emphasized that Kabila has not agreed to a permanent truce.</p><p>''The question of a cease-fire is not part of his vocabulary,'' he said. ''What he is concerned with is that negotiations will lead to the end of hostilities.''</p><p>Kabila had said Friday he would go to the talks only to secure ''Mobutu's exit and the handover of power to the alliance.'' Otherwise, he said, rebel forces would take the rest of Zaire within two weeks.</p><p>After the meeting, Kabila flew to Luanda, Angola. He did not comment to reporters. The Portuguese news agency LUSA said Kabila was to meet with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Zaire and Western powers have accused Angola of aiding the rebels with troops and equipment.</p><p>Mobutu left the ship without addressing reporters and was expected to fly back to Kinshasa. He has insisted he never would bow to Kabila's demand to resign, but his prostate cancer and international pressure may force him to do so.</p><p>Sources close to the talks had said that mediators were seeking an agreement in which Mobutu would step down for health reasons and appoint an interim president until elections could be held. This would allow Kabila and his forces to peacefully enter Kinshasa.</p><p>Wearing his signature leopard-skin cap, a grim-faced Mobutu boarded the ship early Sunday. Supported by a cane in one hand and his wife Bobi Ladawa on the other, the ailing president was met by South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister Joe Modise.</p><p>A White House official, responding to reports that U.S. envoy Bill Richardson was carrying a letter from Mobutu to President Bill Clinton saying that he would step down, said Saturday, ''I would not read it that way.''</p><p>Mobutu did send a letter to the United States last week in which he committed himself to negotiations with the rebels, said the</p><p>ource, speaking on condition of anonymity Saturday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3RY4-5FY0-00BT-M428-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"669\"/><timeReceived>22:05 Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 04, 1997;
