Gunfire flared around the capital and people took to the streets throughout the city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Don't call them rebels, call them liberators!'' one Kinshasan cried in a crowd marching downtown.</p><p>Miguel Kamputu, 18, rolled on his back on the sidewalk, shouting, \"Oh Kabila! Oh Kabila!'' then shaking with laughter. \"Too much suffering. Too much suffering. He is finally here,'' he said.</p><p>As the rebel advance became apparent, confusion erupted in the capital city of five million, with some troops fleeing and civilians picking up and firing abandoned weapons.</p><p>One civilian strode down the street, cigarette dangling from his lip and a grenade launcher swinging on his hip.</p><p>A crowd outside the hotel walked several blocks to the central market, encountering about 25 Zairian troops. As the youths drew near, waving white handkerchiefs, the soldiers fired into the air, then left. Two people were killed, but it was unclear how they died.</p><p>Kabila, in a statement read at a news conference in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi, said: \"Mr. Laurent Desire Kabila assumes from today the functions of the head of state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.''</p><p>The rebels have declared rebel-held areas of Zaire as the Congo, reverting to the name used after independence in 1960 before Mobutu declared the country should be known as Zaire from 1971.</p><p>Kabila said earlier that his forces, numbering about 10,000, were marching on the capital from the airport about 25 km away.</p><p>He said he had just spoken to army generals in Kinshasa and they had assured him all the military were willing to pledge allegiance to the newly declared government headed by the rebel chief.</p><p>\"According to reports from the generals, everyone was ready to take orders from me,'' he said.</p><p>At 11 a.m. Kinshasa time, all Zairian soldiers should lay down their arms in front of rebel forces, he added.</p><p>Kabila, who opposed the dictator Mobutu for more than 30 years, said he expected his forces to have complete control of Kinshasa within hours.</p><p>He said he would form a transitional government of public salvation within 72 hours and a constituent assembly within 60 days.</p><p>\"Our first column is entering the city and we expect to have the city under control by tonight. We want to move rapidly so that lawlessness does not get out of hand,'' Kabila's foreign affairs spokesman, Bizima Karaha, told Reuters by telephone from rebel headquarters in Lubumbashi.</p><p>Mobutu's exact whereabouts and plans remained unclear. Aides said Friday he flew to his northern hometown of Gbadolite, 1,100 km away, for a few days \"rest'' and refused to say he had left Kinshasa for good. But diplomatic sources said they expected the 66-year-old Mobutu, who is dying from prostate cancer, to continue on to Morocco to begin life in exile.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mobutu's soldier son, Capt. Kongolo Mobutu, arrived in Congo's capital Brazzaville today on board a speed boat with around 20 other men, witnesses said.</p><p>Earlier, western military sources said army chief Gen. Marc Mahele Lieko Bokungu - one of the top generals who on Thursday advised Mobutu that troops would not defend the capital and that he should leave - was killed about midnight Friday by a Zairian soldier.</p><p>One of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mahele was accused of being a traitor and shot.</p><p>Mobutu's decision to cede control of his government came after months of cajoling by his former allies, who had seen his departure as the best way to ensure a transition of power without further bloodshed.</p><p>Kabila has promised to undo the damage wrought by Mobutu's nearly 32 years in power - to restore order and integrity and hold democratic elections.</p><p>A government statement, read by Mobutu's information minister at a Friday news conference, said Mobutu retained the title of president but relinquished all power over the handling of state affairs to his government.</p><p>On Thursday night, Mobutu's top generals told their boss they would not guard the capital against rebel attack, according to western diplomats in Kinshasa.</p><p>And witnesses said that just hours after Mobutu's flight, they saw Gen. Nzimbi Ngbale, head of the presidential guard, flee Kinshasa for Brazzaville, Congo, in a boat crossing the river separating the two capitals.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199705170045</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4706-3630-01G6-81DT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 17, 1997 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
