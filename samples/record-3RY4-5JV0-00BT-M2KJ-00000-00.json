According to one well-placed U.S.  official, the rebel leader has indicated he intends to keep control for up to five years, although he would be willing to hold some legislative elections fairly quickly.</p><p>The U.S. diplomatic dickering with Kabila and also with ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko is designed to foster a smooth transition to democracy in resources-rich Zaire.</p><p>Kabila's rebel forces are poised to take the capital, Kinshasa, is a drive the Clinton administration hopes will not be bloody. The approximately 300 American citizens in Zaire are being urged to leave the country and the U.S. embassy has been scaled down.</p><p>One of the stumbling blocks to a peaceful transition is Mobutu's dignity, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  That is, Mobutu is demanding power be transferred to another Zairian figure, at least on an interim basis.</p><p>''He doesn't want to give up to the guy who is defeating him,'' the official said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Clinton administration is getting an ambiguous response from Kabila on staging elections.</p><p>He has told U.S. diplomats there should be a ''period of stabilization'' first, U.S. officials said Thursday. His stance on elections was described as ambiguous.</p><p>''We spoke in terms of significant millions of dollars,'' an official told The Associated Press. ''And Kabila wants to remain in power for some time before holding elections.''</p><p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday she was certain Mobutu was looking for a way to yield power to a transitional government.
