Most of them fled Rwanda in 1994 fearing Tutsi revenge after the Hutu government in power at the time orchestrated the slaughter of about a half-million Tutsis.</p><p>The United Nations and the now-ousted Mobutu government accused Kabila of trying to avenge the genocide by targeting the Hutus, who had occupied refugee camps along Zaire's eastern borders but were pushed further into Zaire as rebel forces came up behind them.</p><p>Kabila denies the allegation and accuses the United Nations of incompetence, a sign of his general insouciance toward the international community.</p><p>Kabila's failure to show up for South African-mediated peace talks in Congo on May 14 a thunderous snub of South African President Nelson Mandela was a striking example of this. So too was Kabila's takeover this month of the national railway, which had been successfully managed by a South African company.</p><p>The United States' U.N. ambassador, Bill Richardson, acknowledged that Kabila needs some ''seasoning'' in the ways of politics, and the U.S. government admits it's leery of Kabila. ''I cannot tell you that we think he is a democrat,'' State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said recently.</p><p>Nevertheless, investors are rushing into rebel-held mining regions to strike deals with Kabila, and the world seems content to ignore his lapses for the time being. Mandela even sent a plane to pick up the rebel chief and fly him to South Africa for talks after Kabila reneged on his promise to go to Congo.</p><p>It's easy to understand, given the fact that compared to Mobutu, just about anyone would look great to Zairians and the West. By driving out the Zairian leader, Kabila managed not only to rid Africa of its premier looter regime but to bring some measure of stability to the entire Central African region.</p><p>Mobutu was at odds with not just the governments of Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, for his backing of Rwanda's former Hutu leaders, but with Angola's government for his support of rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. His ouster cuts off Savimbi's major supply source, giving the tenuous peace there now a better chance of survival.</p><p>''We have on the one side Mr. Kabila, and on the other side Mr.  Mobutu, so the balance is quite good in favor of Kabila no matter what,'' said Valentin Mubake Nombi, a member of parliament under Mobutu who grew to support Kabila's armed battle against the dictator.</p><p>Western diplomats agree, saying that even if the takeover of Kinshasa had erupted in major bloodshed, international criticisms would have quickly passed in favor of encouraging Kabila's political and economic reforms.</p><p>While acknowledging his problems, they note that he's been concentrating more on fighting a war rather than running a country.</p><p>Now that he's won, they say, he can begin the task of transforming the rebel movement into a government that will almost certainly come out on top when compared to its predecessor.</p><p>EDITOR'S NOTE: Tina Susman, the AP West Africa correspondent,</p><p>as covered Africa since 1990.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3RY4-5M00-00BT-M3N2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><timeReceived>08:17 Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 18, 1997;
