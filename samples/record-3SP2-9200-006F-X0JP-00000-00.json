He added that his troops would continue to advance on Kinshasa because no cease-fire had been agreed during his meeting with President Mobutu on 4th May. \" Taking Kinshasa is on our agenda,\" Kabila said. He praised the South African and US attempts to end the crisis and said he regretted the stance adopted by France. He also rejected accusations concerning the maltreatment of refugees. The following is the text of a recorded interview with Ghislaine Dupont in Lubumbashi, broadcast by Radio France Internationale on 7th May; subheadings inserted editorially:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[Dupont] Laurent-Desire Kabila, good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[Kabila] Good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The negotiations with Mobutu</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>Source: Radio France Internationale, Paris, in French 0630 gmt 7 May 97</p></bodyText></section><p>[Q] You are the president of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire [AFDL] and you met Marshal Mobutu on 4th May. After this meeting, it was noted that viewpoints continue to be so divergent that each side is sticking to its position. Are you going to continue to negotiate?</p><p>[A] We are very serious about the problem of negotiations. We will continue to negotiate to avoid violence and bloodshed. It is true that we are obliged to negotiate. We are being very patient with Mr Mobutu. In any case, he recognized that we would be able to obtain what we could not obtain the other day within seven days. So we are waiting.</p><p>[Q] Your troops will continue to advance as long as he does not tender his resignation?</p><p>[A] There was no cease-fire, so I don't see why we should be messing around by marking time on the spot. Our troops are duty bound to advance.</p><p>[Q] Do you think that militarily speaking you can capture Kinshasa without any risk?</p><p>[A] It all depends on what type of risk you are referring to, but taking Kinshasa is on our agenda.</p><p>[Q] Is it going to be within a short time?</p><p>[A] It all depends again on Mr Mobutu's goodwill, if he has any goodwill.</p><p>[Q] Marshal Mobutu has reportedly gone to Libreville. What do you think he is going to do in Libreville?</p><p>[A] I cannot know.</p><p>[Q] Do you have contacts with the Gabonese president?</p><p>[A] We have contacts. Mr Bongo's position is very well known. [Words indistinct].</p><p>[Q] Do you think the Gabonese president can play a mediating role to replace the South Africans or in parallel with them?</p><p>[A] In parallel? It is possible. Any man of goodwill accepted by both sides can play an important role in harmonizing the positions of the two sides.</p><p>Praise for South Africa and the USA</p><p>[Q] Are you satisfied with the South African mediation?</p><p>[A] Yes, very satisfied. It is only that we have often been accused of not being willing to negotiate, although we are the only side who, for many long months, asked for negotiations.</p><p>[Q] Up until now, the Americans appear to be supporting your alliance. Today, do you think there has been a shift in their position?</p><p>[A I personally think the United States has not greatly changed its position. It is true that Mr Mobutu has to go; everybody agrees on that. Well, I have noted that the United States is doing a good job with Mr Mobutu. They have been making him conscious of the dangers he may face if he insists on clinging to power unnecessarily.</p><p>[Q] But he is calling for a transitional government which will comprise all parties?</p><p>[A] But he has been calling for a transitional government which has lasted seven years. Nobody is demanding that this transitional government should comprise people [words indistinct]. So, I do not think anybody should demand anything from me on what we are going to do. We have a lot of political friends in the Congolese [Zairean] opposition - in parties, movements and people in the civil society. We are going to form this transitional government of our own free will and not under any pressure.</p><p>Hopes French position will change</p><p>[Q] When France says there should be elections before anything, and that if you are a democrat you would prefer to hold elections, how do you respond to this position taken by France?</p><p>[Kabila, laughing] It is the issue of the pot calling the kettle black. I think there is another section of France which thinks otherwise. I do not know which France you are talking about.</p><p>[Q] By the way, some American officials are reported to have been holding meetings with you in Lubumbashi. Have any French officials already contacted you?</p><p>[A] Oh, certainly. Quite certainly! We can present them to you, before the media tomorrow, if you like. They are people who have enormous responsibility in French political circles. They are important people and we must obtain their consent before I can disclose their names to the press.</p><p>[Q] Do you regret the position taken by France?</p><p>[A] Oh yes, of course. I hope this position will change. It means that one must obviously take into consideration that we have taken three-quarters of the country, and that we are really democrats, in spite of all that people try say to the mass media to discredit the alliance and myself. What represents our hope is that we have the capacity to modernize this country. France needs this country, which is one of the biggest Francophone countries.</p><p>Rejects \"political\" accusations regarding refugees</p><p>[Q] My last question, Laurent-Desire Kabila: You were criticized by the UN secretary-general on the problem of refugees. He accused you of having massacred refugees -</p><p>[Kabila, interrupting] It is purely a political accusation to try to save a regime in Zaire which is crumbling. They are blaming the refugee problem on me as if I am in charge of the refugee problem. [EU official] Mrs Bonino has just spoken today accusing Mr Kabila [words indistinct] in the east. There is nothing like that, these are manipulations.</p><p>[Q] And for what purpose?</p><p>[A] Precisely because they want to force us to accept compromises, to accept their own agents, their own friends, who have destroyed our country. We cannot, in any way, work with them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCSWB1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3SP2-9200-006F-X0JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10962</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1009\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>BBC Summary of World Broadcasts</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 British Broadcasting Corporation</copyright><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 8, 1997, Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>RADIO FRANCE </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>RADIO FRANCE </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM6W</classCode><className>CEASEFIRES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001456</classCode><className>REBELLIONS &amp; INSURGENCIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DNVT</classCode><className>ABUSE &amp; NEGLECT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001480</classCode><className>RESIGNATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001424</classCode><className>PUBLIC BROADCASTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N515000CC</classCode><className>BROADCASTING INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX118</classCode><className>LIBREVILLE, GABON</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX115</classCode><className>PARIS, FRANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC394</classCode><className>CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC390</classCode><className>GABON</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR102</classCode><className>CENTRAL AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR114</classCode><className>CARIBBEAN ISLANDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GR118</classCode><className>LATIN AMERICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
