One of his aides said he was not expected to return to his strife-torn country before next week.  week.  week.</p><p>Gwamona, a member of a rebel delegation which took part in initial peace talks in South Africa last month, said \"any suspension of hostilities can only come\" once Mobutu, in power since 1965, has stood down.</p><p>\"Those who want a ceasefire before talks have the sole aim of weakening the (rebel) Alliance,\" which began its insurrection last October and has seized control of a vast swathe of eastern Zaire, he said.</p><p>At the weekend, rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila said his men were on the verge of taking Kisangani, having already overrun two more key towns - Lubutu and Kindu - and the last main camp for Rwandan Hutu refugees.</p><p>Rebel advances have led thousands of refugees to flee. Kabila had warned of an assault against Tingi-Tingi where he charged that Rwandan former government troops and extremist Hutu militias were being armed by the Zairean army and intimidating and torturing refugees.</p><p>A rebel foreign affairs official, Bizima Karaha, ruled out the idea of a national unity government and said: \"We are fighting for the liberation of our country, not to obtain jobs as some malicious people suggest.\"</p><p>He also appeared to exclude any partition of Zaire, but also said that retaining the territorial integrity of the country was \"not a problem for the Alliance unless as the Kinshasa regime remains in power\".</p><p>The latest rebel gains were \"successes for a popular army which is fighting mercenaries\", Karaha added, stating that \"Mobutu is counting on two armies which carried out genocide in their own countries, Rwandan Hutus and Bosnian Serbs.\"</p><p>The government claims that the rebels are backed by Tutsi-led regimes in Rwanda and Burundi and by Uganda, which had been a home in exile for many of the Rwandan Tutsi rebel soldiers who seized power in Kigali after the 1994 genocide of more than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p><p>All three neighbouring countries deny this.</p><p>The rebels' 'justice minister', Kongolo Mwenze, on Monday denounced what he called \"manoeuvring on the question of Hutu refugees by some countries such as France and Belgium to put the Mobutu regime back in the saddle.\"</p><p>He appeared to be referring to renewed international calls for a foreign buffer force to go to Zaire to help refugees, which was last month mooted again by the Organisation of African Unity, France and senior UN officials.</p><p>\"Everybody knew that Tingi-Tingi was a military camp as well as a refugee camp,\" Mwenze stressed.</p><p>The coordinator for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the rebel-held eastern Kivu provinces, Filippo Grandi, said that evacuating some 160,000 refugees from the Tingi-Tingi region would be a \"nightmare in view of logistical difficulties\".</p><p>But in Nairobi, a spokeswoman for the UN World Food Programme (WFP), Brenda Barton, said that the camps at Tingi-Tingi \"appeared empty\" when aid workers flew over the region on Sunday.</p><p>Barton earlier said that about 10,000 people, apparently Rwandan and Burundian Hutus, had been spotted moving through forest towards Punia, 135 kilometres (85 miles) south of the Lubutu and Tingi-Tingi region. Punia is already home to 4,000 refugees.</p><p>Truckers arriving in Kisangani, 250 kilometres (155 miles) north of the former camp, reported that thousands of refugees were on the road around Ubunda, 150 kilometres (95 miles) south of the threatened government stronghold.</p><p>Kabila on Sunday indicated that thousands of refugees were moving back to Tingi-Tingi, called on the UNHCR to help them, and said that the rebels would set up safe corridors for them to go home to Rwanda.</p><p>The UNHCR spokesman in Nairobi, Peter Kessler, on Monday gave a guarded welcome to this invitation.</p><p>\"It could be good news, if we had security and if we could have mobility,\" he said, \"… but we cannot work in the middle of a war.\"</p><p>The main exiled Hutu organisation, the Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda (RDR), on Monday urged \"humanitarian organisations still faithful to their mission\" urgently to help some \"half a million refugees …  cast into the forest, without assistance and under rebel guns.\"</p><p>RDR spokesman Chris Nzabandora accused aid workers of a \"shameful retreat\" in pulling out of the camp and also in withdrawing from Kisangani last week because of the rebel threat.</p><p>luc-hn/nb/ns</p><p>AFP</p><p>Zambia will beef up its defences in the north of the country as refugees continue to flee the civil war in neighbouring Zaire, Finance Minister Ronald Penza said Monday.</p><p>\"The situation is fluid, especially if we have a lot of people coming with arms. They can conquer our country,\" Penza told reporters at Mbala air force base about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north of the capital Lusaka.</p><p>Zambia hosts some 6,000 Zairean refugees at Natende camp in the northern provincial capital of Kasama, most of them having arrived through Mpulungu port on Lake Tanganyika.</p><p>The government is concerned with the possibility of increased insecurity in the area as a dozen Zairean soldiers were caught with guns as they arrived from the war-torn country three weeks ago.</p><p>Sources at Mpulungu told AFP that there could be more guns hidden in the ships that brought the refugees, several of which are still docked at the harbour.</p><p>Penza said after a visit to the area that more defence and security personnel would be deployed there.</p><p>The refugee issue had to be tackled immediately, Penza said, adding that he would present an assessment of the financial impact of the influx to parliament.</p><p>kc/lb/dw</p><p>AFP afp afp</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP1997 AFP1997 AFP1997</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1334\"/><timeReceived>0312 0312 0312</timeReceived><timeReceived>03:12 GMT gmt gmt</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>$% Agence France Presse -- English english english</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Agence France Presse presse presse</copyright><publicationDate month=\"03\" day=\"03\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>March 03, 1997 1997 1997</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH english english</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Eligibility for Refugee Status</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjFFMzM2M0FCN0QyNDM0QTgzQzQyRTkzRkVBOTg5MzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUM5ODIzNEVDM0VCNDU1OTkyMDZCRUU1Q0ZCMzM4NDM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001456</classCode><className>REBELLIONS &amp;
