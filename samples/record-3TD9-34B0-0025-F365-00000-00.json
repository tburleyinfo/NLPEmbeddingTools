Asked by reporters if he would indeed be nominated as Kabila's prime minister, Mbayi said: \"He can always ask.\"</p><p>Kabila has come under international pressure, in particular from the United States, to include Tshisekedi in his government to ensure a broad-based democratic appeal after more than three decades of autocratic rule by the deposed Mobutu, who has gone into exile.</p><p>\"We expect Tshisekedi to be included but the whole question is what role he will have,\" said a US official in Washington.</p><p>The US ambassador to Kinshasa, Daniel Simpson, held discussions with various political factions earlier in the day, the official said.</p><p>Kabila had been due to name his interim government on Tuesday, within a promised three days from Saturday, but reportedly delayed the announcement until after talks between his officials and Tshisekedi.</p><p>Marshal Mobutu meanwhile was still in the Togolese capital of Lome.</p><p>But the ousted dictator, who is recovering from surgery for prostate cancer, was reportedly too sick to receive his old friend and current host President Gnassingbe Eyadema.</p><p>More than 90 members of Mobutu's family and entourage arrived Wednesday afternoon in N'Djamena, the capital of Chad, reporters there observed.</p><p>Among them were the dictator's elder sister and her husband General Boluzi, head of the gendarmerie under the Mobutu regime. The whole group was put up in one of the capital's hotels, the Tchadienne (Chadian), near to which Mobutu owns a villa.</p><p>Mobutu, \"health permitting,\" is expected to make the trip to N'Djamena later with his doctors.</p><p>However, officials indicated that the group's stay in the country was only provisional until they could find a country prepared to host them permanently.</p><p>European representatives of the new regime in Kinshasa said that they had asked France not to grant exile to the ousted leader, who is accused of pillaging billions of dollars from state coffers.</p><p>They also requested authorities to seize his luxury villa near Monaco on the French Riviera.</p><p>\"We are appealing solemnly to the French government,\" Leonard She Okitundu, a member of the Geneva-based European Alliance office, told a press briefing.</p><p>If Paris grants exile to its former ally there will be \"consequences now that we're in power,\" he warned.</p><p>A French government official in Paris said Tuesday Mobutu had not requested shelter in France, recalling that Morocco and South Africa had both offered refuge to the exile-seeker.</p><p>The French government is expected to await the results of the legislative elections May 25 and June 1 before making a decision on the matter.</p><p>French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said Wednesday evening that a \"democratic transition\" was needed in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>\"If another non-democratic regime succeeds that of Mobutu, where would the progress be?\" he said in a television interview.</p><p>In the meantime, France's ambassador to Kinshasa Michel Rougagnou has requested an audience with Kabila, which some have interpreted as a de facto recognition of his regime.</p><p>The purpose of the meeting would be to transmit a message aimed at organising democratic elections, the French foreign ministry said.</p><p>db/cm/gk</p><p>Laurent Kabila was expected to usher in the post-Mobutu era with the announcement of his new government Wednesday as he attempted to make the transition from jungle guerrilla to statesman.</p><p>Kabila flew into Kinshasa under darkness late Tuesday accompanied by a plane carrying senior members of his alliance, including the top officials for foreign affairs and finance.</p><p>Kabila immediately established his headquarters in the residence of former prime minister Likulia Bolongo, who fled the country as Kabila's rebels advanced on the capital at the weekend.</p><p>The immediate area, on the Congo River in Kinshasa's residential Gombe district, has been sealed off since his arrival in the capital of what used to be Zaire. Kabila has renamed the country the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>Kabila had been due to name his interim government on Tuesday, within a promised 72 hours from Saturday, following the defeat of Mobutu's forces by Kabila's rebel army which sent the ousted Zairean president into exile in Togo.</p><p>But according to local press reports Wednesday, Kabila delayed the announcement until after a meeting between the alliance and former prime minister Etienne Tshisekedi.</p><p>The self-appointed president is under enormous popular and diplomatic pressure to hand 64-year-old Tshisekedi the role of prime minister of his new administration, but a deal with the long-time political heavyweight had yet to be cut by late Tuesday.</p><p>The Alliance Secretary General Deogratias Bugera was due to hold talks with Tshisekedi on Tuesday, but the meeting was postponed for apparent protocol reasons, newspapers here quoting diplomatic sources said.</p><p>Newspaper editorials have been urging Kabila to bring Tshisekedi aboard a broad-based government.</p><p>Tshisekedi, who leads the main opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress, was a consistent thorn in the side of deposed despot Mobutu Sese Seko, after splitting with him in the 1980s to found his own party.</p><p>He flew to the French Riviera to meet the convalescing Mobutu at his villa last November, afterwards declaring himself head of a national unity government. He was appointed to succeed sacked prime minister Kengo Wa Dondo last month, but was forced to stand down almost immediately.</p><p>Diplomatic and public opinon here Wednesday appeared to suggest that no properly balanced government can be formed without him.</p><p>However Kabila's top finance official, Mawampanga Mwana Nanga, told reporters before leaving Lubumbashi with Kabila that the new government would exclude Mobutu supporters.</p><p>\"It will not include political parties,\" he added, with all members of the new government being chosen as individuals.</p><p>But Mawampanga said political parties would \"definitely\" be allowed to contest upcoming elections, which he said would be held \"within 12 months.\"</p><p>Governments around the world have rushed to recognise Kabila as head of state and to acknowledge the Democratic Republic of Congo, the new name for Zaire.</p><p>db/jp/dw</p><p>Belgium Wednesday granted de facto recognition to the new regime in its former colony, the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>\"There is a new government which we recognize de facto, foreign ministry spokesman Andre Querton told reporters, referring to the new regime in what used to be called Zaire.</p><p>bpi/dw/gd</p><p>Belgium Wednesday granted de facto recognition to the new regime in its former colony, the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>\"There is a new government which we recognize de facto,\" foreign ministry spokesman Andre Querton told reporters, referring to the new regime in what used to be called Zaire.</p><p>However, Querton added that Brussels did not envisage \"any formal act of recognition.\"</p><p>Rebel leader Laurent Kabila ousted Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last weekend, declared himself president and renamed Zaire the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke on Saturday refused to give official recognition to Kabila's new rulers, saying: \"The Belgian government never recognises regimes, it recognises countries.\"</p><p>bpi/bl/dw dw</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP1997 AFP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3TD9-34B0-0025-F365-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2107\"/><timeReceived>2109 2109</timeReceived><timeReceived>21:09 GMT gmt</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English english</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Agence France Presse presse</copyright><publicationDate month=\"05\" day=\"21\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 21, 1997 1997</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH english</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>ALLIANCE OF DEMOCRATIC FORCES </className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>  57%);</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>ALLIANCE OF DEMOCRATIC FORCES </className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>  57%);</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;
