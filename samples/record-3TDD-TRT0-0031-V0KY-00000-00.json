Kengo is a person of double nationality,\" one student leader said.</p><p>\"The only answer that the (army) general staff has for me is to try to neutralise Kengo. Then we will have a solution (to the crisis) in eastern Zaire.\"</p><p>Professing their determination to fight the rebels in the east of the country, who they claim are suppored by the Rwandan government, they said all they needed were weapons to fight with.</p><p>\"None of the students are happy about what is happening. The government is irresponsible. It is doing absolutely nothing.\"</p><p>Both students are to be buried Friday.</p><p>Kengo is accused by the students of being too soft on the mainly Tutsi rebels, and of being partly of Tutsi origin himself.</p><p>Thursday's demonstration was the third in a week in Kinshasa following one on Friday and the biggest so far on Tuesday.</p><p>The students have pledged to continue demonstrating until Kengo stands down.</p><p>km/job</p><p>AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP1996</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3TDD-TRT0-0031-V0KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><timeReceived>07:15 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Agence France Presse</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1996 Agence France Presse</copyright><publicationDate month=\"11\" day=\"07\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>November 07, 1996</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>INSTITUT NATIONAL DES HYDROCARBURES &amp; DE LA CHIMIE </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>INSTITUT NATIONAL DES HYDROCARBURES &amp; DE LA CHIMIE </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>  INSTITUT NATIONAL DES HYDROCARBURES &amp; DE LA CHIMIE </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATHS &amp; OBITUARIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008XNH</classCode><className>GENDARMERIE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001480</classCode><className>RESIGNATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001566</classCode><className>SHOOTINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001456</classCode><className>REBELLIONS &amp; INSURGENCIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX357</classCode><className>KINSHASA, CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC394</classCode><className>CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC554</classCode><className>RWANDA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
