After a three-hour meeting, the Palestinian negotiator said the territory to be turned over was insufficient. Foreign Minister David Levy reiterated Israel's position that the peace accords left it to Israel to decide on the size of the pullback, and he indicated that the matter was not closed.   A8<br/> <br/>Offer From Albanian Leader<br/> President Sali Berisha of Albania proposed a plan for a transitional government and national elections, but the offer appeared to be too little and too late to placate the rebels centered in the southern port of Vlore. Rebel leaders said they still wanted the resignation of Mr. Berisha, a hard-line leader widely blamed for failing to curb fraudulent financial schemes that have cost Albanians some $1.5 billion in savings.   A3<br/> <br/>Bonn Is Said to Expel American<br/>A United States diplomat was expelled from Germany after being accused of committing economic espionage against that country, the news magazine Der Spiegel reported. A State Department official said that Germany had notified the United States that an American was to be expelled, but that the person had not yet left. German officials refused to comment.   A6<br/> <br/>Refugees Scatter in Zaire<br/>United Nations officials began searching for tens of thousands of refugees who had scattered into the jungles in eastern Zaire. On their first return after evacuating the region nine days ago, relief officials found several hundred bone-thin people in the ruins of the Tingi Tingi camp, which was overrun by rebels last week. They said more than 100,000 others had either melted into the bush or pushed on to a Government-held town about 80 miles away.   A5<br/> <br/>Ex-Leader Charged in Ecuador<br/>Ecuador's Supreme Court charged former President Abdala Bucaram and four top aides with corruption and embezzlement in a case involving $88 million. After being voted out by Congress last month, Mr. Bucaram and his aides left the presidential palace with 11 burlap sacks stuffed with money, investigators say. Mr. Bucaram's secretary, Oscar Celleri, was arrested carrying $3.4 million in a border town near Peru on Friday. Mr. Bucaram denies any wrongdoing.   (AP)<br/> <br/>Kabul University Reopens<br/>Kabul University reopened its doors for the first time since the Taliban religious army took control of the Afghan capital in September. Many of the buildings were ruined by bomb and rocket attacks, and much of the campus, littered with land mines, is off-limits. The Taliban have banned women from the school as both students and teachers. Before the school was closed, women made up about 60 percent of the teachers and half the student body.   (AP)<br/> <br/>NATIONAL   A10-12, B7-8<br/> <br/>Showdown Looms Over H.M.O. Changes<br/>A showdown is shaping up between Congress and the managed-care industry as both sides weigh the likelihood of legislation to set standards for the quality of care offered by health maintenance organizations. Lawmakers say they are responding to constituents' frustrations with H.M.O.'s. Managed-care companies denounce the prospect of new Federal regulation but find themselves in an awkward position because they also say they want to protect consumers.   A1<br/> <br/>Rap Artist Is Fatally Shot<br/>The Notorious B.I.G., a gangsta rap artist who turned his drug-dealing past on the streets of Brooklyn into a platinum-selling recording career, was killed in Los Angeles in an apparent drive-by shooting. The victim, whose real name was Christopher G. Wallace, was the second big-name rapper to be slain in the last six months. Mr. Wallace, 24, was a fierce rival of Tupac Shakur, who died in September, six days after being shot in a drive-by attack in Las Vegas.   A10<br/> <br/>Rain and Prayer Along the Ohio<br/>Residents along the Ohio River had to contend with more rain in their devastated towns. In Falmouth, Ky., about 100 residents gathered in a single church for worship because most of the rural area's other eight churches had been too badly damaged by the Licking River's floodwaters to be used.   A10<br/> <br/>Labor Shifts Organizing System<br/>American labor leaders are shifting their tactics for organizing workers. They are frequently dropping a 60-year tradition of concentrating on workplace elections to focus on getting at least 51 percent of the employees at a company to sign cards backing a union and then demand that the company recognize it. One result is likely to be more clashes with managers, who often reject recognition requests based on signed cards and demand secret-ballot elections instead.   B7<br/> <br/>Feinstein Alerted on Donations<br/>Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said the F.B.I. had warned her that the Chinese Government might try to funnel illegal contributions to her campaign and other Congressional campaigns through middlemen. But she said the information had not influenced her position or her vote on any issue.   B8<br/> <br/>Dodd Sees No Reform<br/>Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, who was general chairman of the Democratic National Committee at the height of the Clinton re-election drive, said the current reports of abuses in political fund-raising had not stirred up the degree of public outrage needed to force changes. \"Reform will not be passed,\" he said. He called the current fund-raising system \"contaminating,\" but said he was hard at work raising money for his 1998 re-election race anyway.   B8<br/> <br/>NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6<br/> <br/>Trenton Poised to Enshrine Ticket Brokers' Freedom<br/>The New Jersey Legislature is close to passing a bill that would let ticket brokers charge concertgoers and sports fans as much as they could. The state is in the midst of an 18-month experiment with deregulation of ticket brokers; the bill would make that experiment permanent even before its time expires. Whether the experiment has caused ticket prices to go down or up is not likely to be clear before lawmakers act.   B1<br/><br/>Funeral for 2 Killed by Tree<br/>Several hundred people attended a wake and funeral in Queens for two young sisters who were killed when a tree blew down onto their school van. The other two children killed in the accident will be buried today.   B1<br/> <br/>Security Plans in Bayonne<br/>New security measures are to begin this morning at Bayonne High School in New Jersey, where a student was fatally stabbed in a hallway last week. The school's 40 doors will remain locked at all times, except for three that will be open in the morning until 9 A.M. Visitors will be allowed in only at the main entrance, which will be monitored by a video camera. And everyone will be required to wear identification badges throughout the day.   B4<br/> <br/>A Renewed Plea on Abortion<br/>John Cardinal O'Connor joined the nation's other Roman Catholic leaders in urging President Clinton to change his mind and sign a bill that would make certain late-term abortions illegal. The Cardinal's opposition to the procedure, known by its opponents as \"partial birth\" abortion, was not new. But it was given new impetus by an abortion-rights supporter's admission that he had lied last year when he said the procedure was used only rarely.   B3<br/><br/>SPORTSMONDAY   C1-10<br/> <br/>N.C.A.A. Sets Tournament Field<br/>The defending champion, Kentucky, joined Kansas, North Carolina and Minnesota as the highest-seeded teams in the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament. Among the high-profile teams that did not get bids were Syracuse, West Virginia, Fresno State and Michigan.   C1<br/> <br/>ARTS   C11-16<br/> <br/>BUSINESS DAY   D1-12<br/> <br/>TV Ratings' Accuracy Debated<br/>The Nielsen Media Research Company reported that the average number of American households watching prime-time television on all channels fell by well over one million in February. The broadcast networks stepped up their complaints that Nielsen's methods were inaccurate and outdated. They have joined together to help finance an experimental ratings system that they hope will either become a full-fledged competitor to Nielsen or force it to change its methods and answer their complaints.   D1<br/> <br/>Business Digest   D1<br/> <br/>OBITUARIES   B9<br/> <br/>Edward M. Purcell<br/>A Harvard University physicist, he helped make the first detection of radio emissions from clouds of hydrogen in space, a technique that is now a prime astronomical tool. Dr. Purcell shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952 for discovering a way to detect the extremely weak magnetism of the atomic nucleus. He was 84.   B9<br/> <br/>Mac Charles Jones<br/>The Baptist minister who led the National Council of Churches' drive to focus attention on a wave of racist arson fires at black churches in the rural South was 47.   B9<br/> <br/>EDITORIAL   A14-15<br/>Editorials: No change in capital gains, let our jurors go, Philip Taubman on \"Shine.\"<br/> <br/>Columns: Thomas L.
