He sought shelter after being attacked by stone-throwing crowds at a funeral for 340 Tutsis, victims of ethnic massacres.</p><p>Several ministers sought refuge in the Belgian, French and German embassies.</p><p>Ntibantunganya was replaced by Major Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi, who declared himself interim president and announced he would form a transitional government.</p><p>On Sunday, Buyoya said he wanted the deposed leaders to stay in Burundi, saying he would offer them security and a chance to take part in transitional powers.</p><p>Burundi's 5.5 million population is 85 percent Hutu and 14 percent Tutsi.  World leaders fear the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people in three years could degenerate into a bloodbath similar to the one in Rwanda in 1994 which left 500,000 dead.</p><p>The announcement by Mkapa and Museveni followed weekend talks with former Tanzanian head of state Julius Nyerere, the principal African mediator in the Burundi conflict.</p><p>Their statement said: \"The military coup undermines the efforts being undertaken by both regional and world leaders aimed at finding a peaceful and lasting solution to the Burundi conflict that would guarantee security and democracy to all the people of Burundi.\"</p><p>Ugandan government sources said Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire, Kenya and Ethiopia would take part in the summit.</p><p>Leaders of those same countries met on June 25 in Arusha where they agreed to a Burundi government request for military intervention to halt inter-ethnic bloodshed in the west African state.</p><p>That decision was heavily criticised by many in Burundi and the peacekeeping force failed to materialise amid internal squabbles between Ntibantunganya and his Tutsi Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo, who resigned after the coup.</p><p>Mkapa and Museveni underlined \"the importance of the agreement reached at the regional summit\" and called on all parties to respect its recommendations.</p><p>Ugandan government sources also revealed Museveni had received a delegation from Buyoya on Saturday.</p><p>Uganda is considered the neighbour most favourable to the Tutsi minority in Burundi and Rwanda, while Tanzania is considered closer to the Hutus.</p><p>No country has yet recognised Burundi's new authorities.</p><p>The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) condemned the coup. Many western countries, however, despite initial outrage, have largely contented themselves with deploring the interruption of the democratic process in Burundi -- a process initiated by Buyoya during his last term in office.</p><p>Buyoya came to power in 1987 after a coup which ousted then Tutsi president Jean-Baptise Bazaga. He launched a democracy drive which ended in his defeat in the 1993 presidential election.</p><p>Four months later Melchior Ndadaye, the country's first elected Hutu president, was assassinated in a coup bid by the Tutsi-dominated army.</p><p>In another development Sunday, Johannesburg's Sunday Independent said former apartheid agents were shipping illegal arms to Hutu rebels in Burundi and Rwanda.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pope John Paul II led 6,000 people in prayer for the population of Burundi at his summer residence at Castel Gandolfo near Rome.</p><p>vm-sa/jl/km</p><p>AFP</p><p>Former apartheid agents and officials continue to ship illegal South African weapons to be used in conflict-torn Burundi and Rwanda, a report said here Sunday.</p><p>Citing a South African arms investigation commission member and unnamed pilots and cargo crews, Johannesburg's Sunday Independent newspaper said arms, explosives and communications equipment are flowing out of South Africa and Angola to Hutu extremist rebels in Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire.</p><p>The newspaper said the trade is controlled by the same unnamed people who once sold weapons on the black market for South Africa's former white minority government.</p><p>\"In the past few weeks, journalists in Angola have seen planeloads of weapons on Tajiki and Uzbeki cargo planes piloted by Russians,\" the newspaper said. \"Many Russian pilots are employed by South African cargo companies that are said to be involved in the illicit trade.\"</p><p>Pilots often make stopovers in the northeastern Angolan diamond town of Saurimo, the Sunday Independent said.</p><p>Some weapons find their way to northern Zambia where they are shipped by boat on Lake Tanganyika to Burundi and Zaire, the report said.</p><p>On Thursday, Burundi's government was taken over by Major Pierre Buyoya in a bloodless coup that has prompted fears of further bloodshed in the troubled country, where tens of thousands have died in recent years.</p><p>Hutu rebels continue to battle the Tutsi-dominated military, with hundreds of thousands of civilians forced to flee their homes.</p><p>In Rwanda, covert attacks on rural villages by Zaire-based Hutu rebels continue to take place more than two years after a massacre in which an estimated 500,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus died.</p><p>Rwanda's new Tutsi-dominated military has also been accused by the United Nations of conducting much smaller massacres against civilians.</p><p>The Sunday Independent quoted Laurie Nathan, a member of a South African commission investigating arms sales, as saying the trade is linked to diamond smuggling in Angola and Zaire.</p><p>\"The principal players are (rebels with Angola's UNITA group), elements in Zaire and South African private companies and individuals,\" Nathan told the newspaper.</p><p>\"The Commission has received a growing amount of evidence of illegal arms shipments from South Africa over the last 12 to 18 months to other countries in Africa, including Angola, Zaire and Rwanda.\"</p><p>South Africa's government has not sanctioned the deals, which could involve hundreds of tonnes of rifles, handguns, explosives and two-way field radios, the report said.</p><p>During the apartheid era, South Africa was a leading weapons supplier to Rwanda's old Hutu regime, selling 50.2 million dollars worth of arms between 1990 and 1993.</p><p>The trade officially stopped following the 1994 Rwandan genocide, but the United States-based Human Rights Watch said last year that South Africa continued to ship illegal weapons to Rwanda.</p><p>The group said several plane shipments of arms were flown from South Africa to the Kivu region in Zaire, where Rwandan Hutu militias are based.</p><p>South Africa tightened its arms export rules last year, and disallowed the state-owned military hardware company Armscor the right to issue export licenses.</p><p>The Rwandan government says at least 150 tonnes of small arms, grenades and explosives were ferried to the region on Lake Tanganyika from a Zambian port.</p><p>gam/gd</p><p>AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata
