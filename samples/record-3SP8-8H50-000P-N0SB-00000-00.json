And the second-ranking official in Mr. Mobutu's party, Banza Mukalay, also said tonight, \"We have decided to share power, including with the rebellion, during a transition period.\"</p><p>But political specialists here said that Mr. Mobutu, who has managed to outmaneuver his opponents since his supreme rule was challenged in 1991, may be simply trying to buy himself more time in what looks like an increasingly doomed effort to cling to power.</p><p>\"This is clearly a preparatory step,\" said a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"Mobutu knows that his days are numbered, and he is trying to prolong them.\"</p><p>The rebel alliance, which already controls the eastern third of the country and is poised to take Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city, rejected Mr. Mobutu's overture and warned that it would treat as an enemy anyone who accepted the post of Prime Minister in a Mobutu Government.. On Sunday, Mr. Mobutu made his first public appearance and promised that in the next 48 hours he would have a plan to stop the rebels' attempt to overthrow his government. The rebels, known as the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, have rejected international pressure for a cease-fire and confidently proclaimed that they will win the war by marching into this sprawling capital city by June.</p><p>The rebels are said to be about 100 miles from Lubumbashi.</p><p>While, it is clear to almost everyone that the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, will win the war, he faces a greater political fight whenever he invades this capital city. Mr. Kabila has announced that he would not let any existing political party participate in a transitional government.</p><p>Mr. Kabila's move to exclude opposition leaders, particularly Etienne Tshisekedi, from the Government, does not sit well with people here. While Mr. Tshisekedi enjoys strong backing, many here in recent days have come to view Mr. Kabila suspiciously as a potential second incarnation of Mr. Mobutu.</p><p>\"We've been fighting for democracy for years,\" said Alphonse Lupumba Kamanda, president of the Republican Front, which supports Mr. Tshisekedi. \"If Kabila can put an end to dictatorship, then we say yes. But if he comes with his guns, we will say no. We can't chase one dictator only to end up with another.\"</p><p>But Western officials here said that Mr. Tshisekedi's moment to lead Zaire is well behind him. \"I don't think Tshisekedi is a player,\" said a senior Western diplomat. \"You see his press saying it has to be settled by sitting Mobutu, Tshisekedi and Kabila around a table. But I don't think Kabila sees any reason to deal Tshisekedi into the game.\"</p><p>Zaire's war began last October, when Zairian ethnic Tutsi began an uprising in the eastern border region. The rebel movement was widely believed to have had the backing of Rwanda, Uganda, and Angola, all countries with scores to settle with Mr. Mobutu for having supported uprisings in their own country.</p><p>After weeks of empty declarations from the Government, Mr. Mobutu could have seized the occasion to name a Prime Minister today, particularly Mr. Tshisekedi, who led the Government twice during 1993, Zairian leaders and people on the street interviewed here said.</p><p>The crisis is being hotly debated today in the streets of Kinshasa, the capital. Throughout most of the day, the residents were anticipating a bolder move from the dictator, who is suffering from advanced prostate cancer. Many people said they had been expecting him to announce his resignation, or at least to name a Prime Minister.</p><p>So tonight when Mr. Mobutu failed to appear in person, there was deep disappointment.</p><p>In bars in the working class neighborhood of Matonga, at the university and on the streets, people said they had been expecting Mr. Mobutu to announce his resignation.</p><p>\"I want Mobutu to go,\" said Paul Tsimva, 40, an unemployed civil servant. \"He has done nothing for the country except to enrich his friends and his cronies.\"</p><p>Such talk, which never would have been heard here during the years when Mr. Mobutu was the unquestioned ruler, was echoed over and over.</p><p>The stage was set for a challenge to Mr. Mobutu in 1991 after Zaire's economy nearly collapsed, forcing Western donors to intervene politically here. Mr. Mobutu reluctantly agreed to share power then, but by manipulating divisions in the opposition, he managed to avoid actually doing so until the civil war erupted in the eastern region.</p><p>\"Mr. Mobutu must exit the political stage gracefully,\" said an African diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"But that is difficult in our continent. After 30 years in power it is difficult to accept defeat.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Laurent Kabila, the Zairian rebel leader, sat next to Mohammed Sahnoun, United Nations special envoy, in a limousine leaving Lumumba Stadium in Kisangani, where thousands of his supporters rallied Saturday.
