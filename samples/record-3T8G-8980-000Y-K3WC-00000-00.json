He briefed French diplomats after his nine-day shuttle diplomacy, which included several meetings with Kabila and Mobutu,</p><p>Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, refused to say whether Mobutu would go into exile, though he all but acknowledged the dictator's nearly 32-year reign was coming to an end.</p><p>\"The ultimate solution will involve a transitional government - there's going to be a change in Zaire,\" Richardson said.</p><p>In a statement, the leaders of five regional Zairian allies called on the Zairian Armed Forces to prepare for elections and said Mobutu was too ill to contest the vote. Mobutu signed the statement, along with the presidents of Gabon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Chad and the foreign minister of Cameroon.</p><p>The document, read aloud at a news conference, made no mention of Mobutu resigning or giving power to a transitional authority that would include Kabila, as the rebel chief has demanded.</p><p>When Mobutu was asked if he intended to return to Kinshasa this weekend, he replied angrily, \"Why not?\"</p><p>Zaire's information minister, Kin-Kiey Mulumba, dismissed speculation that Mobutu had used the sudden trip to Gabon to go into exile. He threatened to expel foreign media who had suggested as much.</p><p>South African government spokesman Parks Mankahlana also said claims Mobutu would not return to Kinshasa had been \"largely exaggerated.\"</p><p>But Western diplomats and military observers said some high-ranking Zairian military officers close to Mobutu had already left the country or sent their families out, apparently fearing Mobutu's imminent fall. The latest to leave was Gen. Kpama Baramoto, former army chief of staff, according to officials speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Another general, Etienne Nzimbi Ngbale, who commands Mobutu's presidential guard, has sent his family out of Zaire, they said.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the city of Kenge, about 115 miles east of the capital, aid agencies reported Wednesday that 300 people may have been killed in fighting there. There was no independent verification of the claim. The Red Cross said 10 of its local workers in Kenge were among the dead.</p><p>The rebels acknowledged Wednesday they were facing stiff resistance from government soldiers in Kenge, whose airport could serve as a staging ground for flying troops into Kinshasa to secure the international airport.</p><p>The government insists it remains in control of the area and denies rebel allegations that mercenaries from Angola's former rebel movement are assisting Mobutu, who backed the guerrillas during Angola's 20-year civil war.</p><p>Both Kabila and Mobutu have used foreign forces in their seven-month standoff. Kabila has received help from Uganda and Rwanda; Mobutu used mercenaries from eastern Europe.</p><p>South Africa, which hosted the first face-to-face meeting between Mobutu and Kabila on a South African ship off the Congolese coast on Sunday, sought to arrange another round of talks for Wednesday, despite speculation the rebels would be in control of Kinshasa by then.</p><p>Richardson said there was \"a good chance\" of a second meeting. The first round of talks provided no breakthroughs toward a peaceful settlement.</p><p>Diplomats in the capital, however, have expressed doubts the two leaders would meet again. They say the best hope is to clear the way for a calm transfer of power in which Mobutu, 66, and ill with prostate cancer, resigns for health reasons and Kabila takes over as head of a transitional authority until elections.</p><p>If Kabila fails to call early elections, they note, Western nations might withhold desperately needed aid. They also say that Kabila would be wise to hold elections quickly to take advantage of his wave of popularity and rising disgust with Mobutu.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-8980-000Y-K3WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"727\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 8, 1997, Thursday, AM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
