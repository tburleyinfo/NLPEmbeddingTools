But delays related to Kabila's arrival led first to a postponement of the meeting, then cancellation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have had a communication a little while ago that Mr. Kabila will not be coming to Pointe-Noire,\" said U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The plan had called for the meeting to take place while the ship was docked at Pointe-Noire, and South African officials said Kabila had been aware of the arrangement for days and had agreed.</p><p>Sahoun said Kabila today demanded the ship set sail and be in international waters before he boarded.</p><p>\"There was a telephone from President Mandela in which he asked that the ship should go to the high seas,\" Sahnoun told reporters, referring to the South African president who was to chair the talks.</p><p>\"President Mandela reminded him that he had already agreed that he should come to Pointe-Noire. President Mandela said the ship will not go to the high sea for the meeting, and therefore the meeting will not be held,\" he said.</p><p>Mobutu, looking frail, arrived in Pointe-Noire earlier in the day and got into a motorcade headed for the harbor.</p><p>A top Kabila aide, Moise Nyarugabo, said the rebel alliance also had received information that Kabila could be in danger on or near the ship. He did not elaborate.</p><p>The talks had taken on a sense of urgency, with rebel troops closing in on the capital, although the rebels had pledged to slow their advance for the duration.</p><p>Rebel radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., said the fighters were \"slowing down their advance to Kinshasa for political and strategic reason.\"</p><p>But a Western diplomat and Zairian military officials, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebels had reached the Black River, 60 miles outside Kinshasa and the last major defensive position before the capital.</p><p>The increasingly unpopular government called on civilians to help the army defend Kinshasa.</p><p>Kinshasa was quiet, both because of a nightly 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew imposed Tuesday and because of a general strike called by opposition parties in an attempt to increase the pressure on Mobutu to resign.</p><p>The strike was widely observed, giving the impression of a lazy Sunday afternoon in the usually loud, chaotic city of 5 million. Markets were deserted and streets empty except for children playing soccer and people out for a stroll.</p><p>Julien Boketshu, 26, said the calm was a sign that people believe Mobutu will go.</p><p>\"We are waiting for Mobutu to resign because we have suffered for many years,\" he said. \"That's why we don't protest. We are waiting for it to happen.\"</p><p>Long supermarket lines indicated that some residents were stocking up on groceries. Plainclothes police roamed downtown, stopping people to demand bribes. A leaflet circulating on the streets urged civilians and soldiers to fly white flags and sing \"songs of joy\" in support of the rebels.</p><p>The curfew was a sign of the government's growing edginess about the rebel advance. In many other cities, civilians and soldiers have gone on major looting sprees before fleeing Kabila's force.</p><p>Even if Mobutu agreed to a peaceful handover of power to Kabila, there are fears troops in the loyal presidential guard would want to grab whatever they could before being forced to surrender or flee.</p><p>A first meeting between Kabila and Mobutu on May 4 left two major issues unresolved: details of a transitional government, and when Mobutu would step down. Mobutu, 66 and ailing with cancer, said he would give up the presidency only after elections. The rebels insist Mobutu surrender power immediately to a transitional authority led by Kabila.</p><p>Because of Mobutu's lack of support among both civilians and troops, Kabila's army has had a relatively easy time capturing three-quarters of Zaire. Soldiers in most cities have put up little resistance.</p><p>But as the rebels moved closer to Kinshasa, fighting has increased. The rebels and some foreign diplomats say Mobutu is getting help from mercenaries - a charge the government denies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-87K0-000Y-K0N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"710\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 14, 1997, Wednesday, PM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
