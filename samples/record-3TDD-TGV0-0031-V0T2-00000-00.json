The authorities earlier requisitioned buses and trucks to bring in crowds for what the pro-government Salongo newspaper on Tuesday forecast would be an \"ecstatic\" welcome.</p><p>Other newspapers claimed the welcome would be a carefully stage-managed media event.</p><p>The scene of conviviality with a smiling Mobutu surrounded by a milling crowd of welcomers contrasted with chaos elsewhere in a country no longer fully under his sway.</p><p>Rebels controlling the east are intent on pressing on to Kinshasa and overthrowing the 66-year-old president.</p><p>Mobutu, whose isolation abroad in Switzerland and France while his impoverished country was embroiled in armed conflict has led to widespread discontent, was expected to waste little time in trying to re-assert his authority.</p><p>He was later going to Tshatshi barracks, where his presidential guard is based, to broadcast to the nation facing political chaos in Kinshasa as well as rebellion in the east.</p><p>Mainly Tutsi rebels have captured a large swathe of eastern Zaire since October, and stated that their eventual aim is to overthrow the 31-year-old Mobutu regime.</p><p>Government troops have been routed from towns in North and South Kivu provinces, including the provincial capitals, Goma and Bukavu.</p><p>Kinshasa accuses Zaire's neighbours, particularly Tutsi-dominated Rwanda, but also Uganda and Burundi, of supporting the rebels.</p><p>Earlier, a fleet of limousines and a minibus took Mobutu, his wife and entourage from the Roquebrune-Cap-Martin villa in the south of France to the Cote d'Azur airport at Nice, where the president boarded one of two DC8 airliners chartered by the Zaire government.</p><p>Mobutu had arrived in France on November 4 after convalescing for two months in a luxury hotel in Lausanne following his surgery for prostate cancer in late August.</p><p>He held several meetings with visiting officials at his luxury cliff-top villa on the French Riviera, where he has otherwise insulated himself from the chaos wracking his country.</p><p>He held talks with several regional leaders who visited the villa as well as UN special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Canadian diplomat Raymond Chretien, who urged him to return home to try to bring peace to the region.</p><p>Mobutu's supporters believe he may be able to lead a counter-offensive in the east to \"boot the enemy across the borders,\" as officials have put it.</p><p>On the political front, newspapers close to Tshisekedi, Mobutu's main rival in the past, are being much quieter than usual in denouncing the \"dictator\" and looking for a reconciliation between their leader and the head of state.</p><p>Tshisekedi's aides argue that the only \"legal\" way out of a political impasse is for the former premier to take back the helm and form a \"national unity government.\"</p><p>Even when he is in the country, public sightings of Mobutu in Zaire are rare. He made a brief visit to Kinshasa in January to commemorate the victims of the air disaster that killed 350 people when a plane crashed into a market near the airport.</p><p>bur-mf/da/gd</p><p>AFP</p><p>Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko on Tuesday left his French Riviera villa to return home after almost five months of absence, official sources said.</p><p>Mobutu, who arrived in France on November 4 to convalescence after medical treatment in Switzerland, is to fly to Kinshasa later in the morning.</p><p>He left his villa at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin at 7.30 a.m. (0630 GMT).</p><p>bur/ccr</p><p>AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP1996</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3TDD-TGV0-0031-V0T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><timeReceived>17:07 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Agence France Presse</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1996 Agence France Presse</copyright><publicationDate month=\"12\" day=\"17\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>December 17, 1996</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>COTE D'AZUR HOLDING  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className> COTE D'AZUR HOLDING </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>COTE D'AZUR HOLDING  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className> COTE D'AZUR HOLDING </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>  COTE D'AZUR HOLDING  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className> COTE D'AZUR HOLDING </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;
