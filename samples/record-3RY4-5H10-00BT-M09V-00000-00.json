Still, he is clinging to his presidency and angrily rejects suggestions he would not return to Zaire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mobutu made the pledge in a statement Thursday he and five other African leaders issued from neighboring Gabon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The editor of the government-run daily newspaper L'Union, Ngoyo Moussavou, said Thursday that the Zairian president planned to return to his country Friday morning. Moussavou said the flight would leave Gabon at 10 a.m. (0900 GMT).</p><p>There was no confirmation from the Zairian government.</p><p>Western diplomats, meanwhile, pushed for a peace settlement between Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent Kabila.</p><p>''The next few days are critical for peace in Zaire,'' U.S.  envoy Bill Richardson said in Paris. He briefed French diplomats after his nine-day shuttle diplomacy, which included several meetings with Kabila and Mobutu.</p><p>Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, refused to say whether Mobutu would go into exile, though he all but acknowledged that the dictator's nearly 32-year reign was coming to an end.</p><p>''The ultimate solution will involve a transitional government _ there's going to be a change in Zaire,'' Richardson said.</p><p>In a statement, the leaders of five regional Zairian allies called on the Zairian Armed Forces to prepare for the ballot and said Mobutu, who has prostate cancer, was too ill to run in the elections.</p><p>The heads of state the presidents of Gabon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Chad and the foreign minister of Cameroon kept Mobutu waiting in the guest room of the presidential palace while they prepared the joint statement.</p><p>At the news conference, the document was read aloud and Mobutu nodded and signed it along with the other representatives.</p><p>The statement made no mention of Mobutu resigning or giving power to a transitional authority that would include Kabila, as the rebel chief has demanded.</p><p>Since promising a transition to democracy in 1990, Mobutu has repeatedly postponed the country's first multiparty elections. But with mounting international pressure and the rebels closing in on the capital, he has in recent weeks repeated his promise.</p><p>After his first face-to-face talks with Kabila on Sunday, he called for a transitional authority to prepare for elections. But his announcement Thursday was the first time that Mobutu conceded that he was too ill to run for office.</p><p>While Western diplomats and military observers have suggested that Mobutu scheduled the Gabon trip as a convenient way to leave the country permanently, the Zairian president has steadfastly denied that.</p><p>Asked during Thursday's news conference whether he planned to return home, Mobutu replied angrily, ''Why not?''</p><p>Zaire's information minister, Kin-Kiey Mulumba, also dismissed the speculation and threatened to expel foreign media who had suggested as much.</p><p>But the diplomats and military observers said some high-ranking Zairian military officers close to Mobutu had already left the country or sent their families out, apparently fearing Mobutu's imminent fall. The latest to leave was Gen. Kpama Baramoto, former army chief of staff, according to officials speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Another general, Etienne Nzimbi Ngbale, who commands Mobutu's presidential guard, has sent his family out of Zaire, they said.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the city of Kenge, about 190 kilometers (120 miles) east of the capital, aid agencies reported Wednesday that 300 people may have been killed in fighting there. There was no independent verification of the claim. The Red Cross said 10 of its local workers in Kenge were among the dead.</p><p>The rebels acknowledged Wednesday they were facing stiff resistance from government soldiers in Kenge, whose airport could serve as a staging ground for flying troops into Kinshasa to secure the international airport.</p><p>The government insists it remains in control of the area and denies rebel allegations that mercenaries from Angola's former rebel movement are assisting Mobutu, who backed the guerrillas during Angola's 20-year civil war.</p><p>Both Kabila and Mobutu have used foreign forces in their seven-month standoff. Kabila has received help from Uganda and Rwanda; Mobutu used mercenaries from eastern Europe.</p><p>South Africa, which hosted Sunday's meeting between Mobutu and Kabila on a South African ship off the Congolese coast on Sunday, sought to arrange another round of talks for Wednesday, despite speculation the rebels would be in control of Kinshasa by then.</p><p>Richardson said there was ''a good chance'' of a second meeting.  The first round of talks provided no breakthroughs toward a peaceful settlement.</p><p>Diplomats in the capital, however, have expressed doubts the two leaders would meet again. They say the best hope is to clear the way for a calm transfer of power in which Mobutu, 66, resigns for health reasons and Kabila takes over as head of a transitional</p><p>uthority until elections.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3RY4-5H10-00BT-M09V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"837\"/><timeReceived>20:54 Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 08, 1997;
