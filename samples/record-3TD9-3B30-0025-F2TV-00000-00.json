For us the issue is important.  important.</p><p>\"If it is held elsewhere and it can at least get together and work out a modus operandi for a new democratic Zaire, we will not stand in the way,\" Pahad said.</p><p>\"It is our view -- and the special envoy is of that opinion -- that South Africa still constitutes the best venue for any successful summit to take place and we will continue to offer South African facilities,\" he said.</p><p>Pahad mentioned news reports from Kinshasa quoting the son of ailing Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko -- suffering from prostate cancer -- as saying his father would prefer to meet Kabila in neighbouring Congo, because it is closer.</p><p>He added, however, that neither he nor Sahnoun had received any official word to this effect from Mobutu.</p><p>A source close to the negotiations said South Africa hoped to receive a positive response by Wednesday to the formal invitation President Nelson Mandela sent last week to Mobutu through the Zairean leader's special envoy, Honore Ngabanda Nzambo.</p><p>Questioned by parliamentarians on Kabila's commitment to democracy, Pahad cited a pro-democracy communique issued after talks between the two sides in Pretoria earlier this month.</p><p>\"Kabila on several occasions reiterated his commitment -- he now even spells out a time -- that within a year, after there is consolidation and stability in the country, there will be elections,\" Pahad said.</p><p>\"He has now gone further to say (elections) 'in which all parties will participate'.\"</p><p>Kabila on Saturday toughened his position, saying he would meet Mobutu only to discuss the conditions of his departure, but diplomats here underplayed the importance of his statement as expected political positioning.</p><p>Pahad also warned against the conflict spilling over into neighbouring countries and said Angola, Tanzania and Zambia had already been affected.</p><p>\"The danger to Angola is a very real one,\" he said. \"There are reports of UNITA forces (Angolan former rebels) still in Zaire, there are reports of Katangese forces in Angola returning back to Zaire -- there are constant reports of this sort, which all add to our concern about a possible explosion of that situation.\"</p><p>Floods of refugees have \"had a devastating effect on Tanzania -- deforestation, ecological problems … a massive socio-economic problem,\" he said, adding: \"It is (causing) a similar problem in Zambia.\"</p><p>Speaking of US, British and Belgian forces gathering in Congo and Gabon to evacuate foreign nationals from Kinshasa if the need arises, Pahad said there were no plans at present to evacuate South Africans.</p><p>\"We ourselves have not taken any such precautionary measures,\" he said.  \"Our embassy is still functioning, and we are in daily contact with our embassy.
