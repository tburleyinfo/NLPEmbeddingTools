Kabila had repeatedly warned of an assault against Tingi-Tingi where he charged that Rwandan former government troops and extremist Hutu militias were being armed by the Zairean army and intimidating and torturing refugees.</p><p>A rebel foreign affairs official who deals with English-speaking countries, Bizima Karaha, ruled out the idea of a national unity government and said: \"We are fighting for the liberation of our country, not to obtain jobs as some malicious people suggest.\"</p><p>He also appeared to rule out any partition of Zaire, but also said that retaining the territorial integrity of the country was \"not a problem for the alliance unless the Kinshasa regime remains in power.\"</p><p>The latest military advances by the rebels were \"successes for a popular army which is fighting mercenaries,\" Karaha added, stating that \"Mobutu is counting on two armies which carried out genocide in their own countries, Rwandan Hutus and Bosnian Serbs.\"</p><p>The government counter-claims that the rebels are backed by the Tutsi-led regimes in Rwanda and Burundi and by Uganda, which had been a home in exile for many of the Rwandan Tutsi rebel soldiers who seized power in Kigali after the 1994 genocide of more than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p><p>All three neighbouring countries deny this claim.</p><p>luc-hn/nb/gd</p><p>AFP</p><p>The foreign minister of embattled Zaire, Gerard Kamanda Wa Kamanda, will be received at the French foreign ministry on Monday or Tuesday, a government spokesman said here Monday.</p><p>Foreign ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said Kamanda would be met by the director of the African affairs department in the ministry, Jean-Didier Roisin, and would also hold talks with President Jacques Chirac's Africa advisors.</p><p>Rummelhardt said the meetings will focus on the civil war in eastern Zaire, where mainly Tutsi rebels have seized a vast swathe of territory and are advancing steadily westwards, threatening the government stronghold of Kisangani, a major city.</p><p>The rebels have rejected South African and US calls for a ceasefire until Zaire's autocratic ruler since 1965, President Mobutu Sese Seko, quits power.  Marshal Mobutu is currently on the French Riviera following medical tests after coming to Europe for a cancer operation last year. He is not expected to return to Zaire until next week.</p><p>Rummelhardt said the Zairean conflict was \"at the heart of our concerns and our diplomatic contacts.\"</p><p>\"We believe that the first priority is the ending of hostilities and the withdrawal of all foreign forces. The urgent need is to help people in distress. In this respect, we back the idea of an multinational force under the aegis of the United Nations and support proposals from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,\" he added.</p><p>Zaire accuses the Tutsi-led regimes in neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi of helping the rebels, together with Uganda, while foreign mercenaries, notably Bosnian Serbs, are known to be fighting with Zairean troops.</p><p>An undisclosed number of Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi and displaced Zaireans, believed to be in the hundreds of thousands, are caught up in the conflict and most have abandoned camps, taking to forests and roads where they are without help.</p><p>Rummelhardt said that \"as stressed in the plan drawn up by Mr. Mohamed Sahnoun, special representative of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity, the Zairean crisis will only be settled by dialogue, an electoral process and the convening of an international conference.</p><p>On Saturday, French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said that Marshal Mobutu was \"undoubtedly, today, the only person capable of contributing to the solution to the problem\" of guaranteeing the territorial integrity of Zaire.</p><p>az-php/nb/</p><p>AFP afp afp</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP1997 AFP1997 AFP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3TD9-3PX0-0025-F3R2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><timeReceived>0314 0314 0314</timeReceived><timeReceived>03:14 GMT gmt gmt</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>$% Agence France Presse -- English english english</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Agence France Presse presse presse</copyright><publicationDate month=\"03\" day=\"03\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>March 03, 1997 1997 1997</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH english english</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>UNITED NATIONS </className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>  63%);
