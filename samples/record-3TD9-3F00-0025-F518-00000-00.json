That is our objective, the political capital.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Advance troops had already reached provinces of Bandundu and Equateur, east of Kinshasa, he said.  said.</p><p>Kabila told supporters massed in the town stadium that Mobutu was to blame for all the country's woes, and appealed to Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi \"to leave the Mobutu camp.\"</p><p>The rebel leader, who has already pledged to be in Kinshasa by June, said it was in the Zairean capital \"that all the evil done to this country -- the killing and the pillaging -- was decided. We are going to see these gentlemen on their home patch.\"</p><p>With negotiations between rival delegations in Pretoria adjourning for consultations, Kabila reaffirmed his position that a ceasefire -- the main objective of the talks -- was out of the question \"until Mobutu signs his resignation.\"</p><p>His \"liberation army\" was now \"more than 40,000 strong,\" with 15,000 men due in Mbuji-Mayi in the next few days with the probable objective of marching on Kinshasa, Kabila said, urging the town's youth to enrol with the rebel force since it was \"an army of the sons of the people.\"</p><p>Kabila said he had turned down an offer by South African mediators on the creation of a transitional Zairean government.</p><p>South African Vice President Thabo Mbeki, he said, \"phoned me yesterday evening and told me they had reached a critical point (in negotiatons at Pretoria) and were discussing the creation of a transitional government comprising the Mobutists, the (rebel) Alliance and the opposition.</p><p>\"I answered that the delegates were there to negotiate for the departure of Mobutu, not for seats in government.\"</p><p>He said the talks on a transition government should \"come after his (Mobutu's) surrender of power, and not before.\" It would be a \"transition government without the Mobutists. â€¦ Did you allow the Nazi party, the Italian fascists, to take part in elections after World War II. So why should you expect the Alliance to share power.\"</p><p>He appealed to opposition leader Tshisekedi to \"stop playing the enemy's game.\"</p><p>Addressing the embattled premier, whom he described as \"the devil's premier,\" he said: \"If a leader gets it wrong, it's the activist's job to tell him so, and not to follow him blindly.\"</p><p>Tshisekedi's place, he said, was \"not with Mobutu but against Mobutu.\" To the cheers of the crowd he said: \"We are all in the same trench against a single enemy.\"</p><p>The Zairean opposition withdrew its support for Tshisekedi on Saturday after he formed a cabinet without consulting the president or his own parties and said he wanted to dissolve parliament.</p><p>Kabila's conciliatory tone appeared to be addressed to Tshisekedi's numerous sympathisers in the Mbuji-Mayi region, whom he warned against Mobutu's customary \"divide and rule\" tactics.</p><p>The hardening of the rebel leader's position towards Mobutu came as negotiations in Pretoria between representatives of Kabila and Mobutu -- but not Tshisekedi, who dismissed the talks as \"pointless\" -- adjourned after four days for consultations.</p><p>The talks appeared to have stalled on the issue of a ceasefire.</p><p>Fighting was reported from southern Zaire where despite numerous defections on Monday, government troops defending the second city of Lubumbashi appeared to be offering stiffer resistance than expected to Kabila's advancing forces.</p><p>cpy/bb/ml</p><p>AFP afp</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP1997 AFP1997</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><timeReceived>0816 0816</timeReceived><timeReceived>08:16 GMT gmt</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English english</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Agence France Presse presse</copyright><publicationDate month=\"04\" day=\"08\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>April 08, 1997 1997</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH english</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001456</classCode><className>REBELLIONS &amp;
