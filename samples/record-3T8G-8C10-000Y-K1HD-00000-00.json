Rebels also took Lisala, Mobutu's birthplace, about 150 miles south of the president's hometown of Gbadolite, a rebel officer said.</p><p>During a news conference with a grim-faced Mobutu and smiling Kabila, Sahnoun told reporters aboard a South African naval ship that South African President Mandela, who was helping to mediate the talks, would reconvene another meeting between the two rivals within six to 10 days to narrow the gap between them.</p><p>Sahnoun told reporters that Mobutu had proposed a cease-fire and the creation of a transitional government that would prepare the Central African nation for its first multiparty elections. Mobutu said he would hand over power to such an elected president.</p><p>But Kabila, according to the statement read by Sahnoun, is demanding that the rebel alliance be allowed to take over power as the transitional authority and that Mobutu cede power to them.</p><p>Mobutu left the ship without making any comment to reporters and was expected to fly back to Kinshasa later in the day. Kabila was en route to Angola.</p><p>Mandela emphasized that a permanent cease-fire had not been agreed to by Kabila.</p><p>\"The question of a cease-fire is not part of his vocabulary,\" he said. \"What he is concerned with is that negotiations will led to the end of hostilities.\"</p><p>Kabila said Friday he would go to the talks only to secure \"Mobutu's exit and the handover of power to the alliance.\" Otherwise, he said, rebel forces would take the rest of Zaire within two weeks.</p><p>Mobutu has insisted he never would bow to Kabila's demand to resign, but his illness and international pressure may force him to do so.</p><p>Sources close to the talks had said that mediators were seeking an agreement in which Mobutu would step down for health reasons and appoint an interim president until elections could be held.</p><p>This would allow Kabila and his forces to peacefully enter Kinshasa.</p><p>Wearing his signature leopard-skin cap and looking grim, Mobutu boarded the ship early Sunday.</p><p>Supported by a cane in one hand and his wife on the other, the ailing president was met by the South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister Joe Modise.</p><p>Kabila was flown to the ship from Angola late Saturday night, a day after he balked at attending the negotiations, citing security concerns.</p><p>A White House official, responding to reports that U.S. envoy Bill Richardson was carrying a letter from Mobutu to President Clinton saying that he would step down, said Saturday, \"I would not read it that way.\"</p><p>Mobutu did send a letter to the United States last week in which he committed himself to negotiations with the rebels, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity Saturday.</p><p>A U.S. official in Kinshasa said nine Americans - non-essential staff and dependants of embassy employees - left the city on Saturday as a \"precautionary measure\" because of the confusion surrounding the peace talks.</p><p>The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Americans took a ferry to neighboring Congo. Thirty-eight Americans remain at the embassy, including Ambassador Daniel Simpson. Several hundred other Americans remain in Kinshasa.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-8C10-000Y-K1HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 4, 1997, Sunday, BC cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
