These are the ones who killed in this country and are now busy disturbing the peace in various parts of our country. I want to say that although we are on the right path and have made achievements and aim to move forward, we must find a solution to the problem. Finding a solution to the problem is not easy, but also not very difficult. We can search for an answer somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Finding a solution needs all Rwandans to work positively for their country, to distance themselves from the evil practised by some Rwandans, and not just sit and watch but play an active role.</p><p>The policies of those who took part in causing the country problems are not easily abandoned. This is why we are currently witnessing events in the Zairean areas of Masisi, Rutshuru phonetic and other places. Rwandan genocide perpetrators carried out their acts against Rwandans they found living in Zaire as Zaireans. This is a proof that evil deeds are part of their political thinking. This is not enough for them and they are still making plans to return to the country to disturb peace in Rwanda.</p><p>As Rwandans who decided to fight the evil deeds, as we did earlier and still wish to do, we should focus our attention on this issue. I mean the issue of those who have recently been killed by Rwandans who had earlier killed people in this country. What I can say is that this should not deter us from our programme - though we must find a solution to the problem at all costs. We must find a remedy whatever its cost applause .</p><p>It is important that everything legal be done to stop this. This will definitely cause \"casualties\" preceding word in English , injuries applause . There is no doubt about this and no one should fear this. It is unbelievable that some people should enter the country, select people and kill them: they kill survivors of earlier killings and continue doing so. The job of stopping this is for the soldiers in front here and others who are not present - and it is also the duty of all Rwandans present here and those who are not present - who understand that such acts do not benefit the country but discourage everybody…</p><p>I would also like to call on Rwandans not to be misled by rumours. I urge Rwandans not to listen to some rumours which are spread among the people, some which are believed. Those who spread them are those who invented them in order to create the desired effect. Some rumours are aimed at businessmen, successful people in the country and intellectuals, saying they have had their day and that they will be killed. I would like to tell those who believe them that they are unfounded. Whoever does such a thing is a criminal like all the ones described before, and our plans for them are similar to all the others.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCSWB1996</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3S51-J370-0017-G31M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10962</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"549\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>BBC Summary of World Broadcasts</publicationName><copyright>KANSAS ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE SERVICEKANSAS ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE SERVICE#THE#STATE#OF#KANSAS#</copyright><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>July 5, 1996, Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D9R3</classCode><className>ETHNIC CONFLICTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009S69</classCode><className>GENOCIDE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DL63</classCode><className>PAUL KAGAME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX275</classCode><className>KIGALI, RWANDA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC554</classCode><className>RWANDA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR104</classCode><className>EASTERN AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR118</classCode><className>LATIN AMERICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR114</classCode><className>CARIBBEAN ISLANDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
