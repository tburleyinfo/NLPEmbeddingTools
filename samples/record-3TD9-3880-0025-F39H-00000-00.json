A ceasefire would mean that our people will lose much after its sacrifices. The liberation must not stop.</p><p>\"We are very optimistic. The man who has corrupted, killed and brought poverty to this country has agreed to go,\" Karaha claimed, but he added that Mobutu \"could yet trick the international community\" by saying he is ready to meet Kabila and then failing to do so, as happened regarding previous talks mooted in South Africa.</p><p>Mobutu had been due on Thursday to fly to the Gabonese capital, Libreville, but the trip was cancelled without any explanation.  Libreville had been proposed as one possible venue for talks.</p><p>Karaha added that the alliance would prefer talks to take place on Sunday, but \"can be flexible\" about the date.</p><p>On the question of a transitional government which the United States has been pushing for, Karaha said Mobutu supporters could not take part.</p><p>\"There will be a government and the alliance will not be greedy.  The people will participate freely. But the 'Mobutists' should leave power to others, after 32 years,\" he said, adding that \"real elections\" will be held.</p><p>A US special envoy, Bill Richardson, on Thursday held talks in Libreville with Bongo and was due to go on to Luanda later in the day. He said he would attend the first part of any talks between Kabila and Mobutu.</p><p>The United States has been pushing to avoid a bloodbath in Kinshasa. The rebels have strengthened their hold around the capital by taking the town of Kikwit, 500 kilometres (300 miles) to the east, which is a strategic road junction and food supply route for the capital.</p><p>Kabila himself said Thursday that his forces would continue to march on Kinshasa despite the planned meeting with Mobutu. He was speaking after talks in Harare with Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, who will take over as chairman of the Organisation of African Unity in June.</p><p>Meanwhile Thursday, more than 10,000 workers, including airline staff, shoe-shiners, railway workers and market women, held a colourful march for three hours in Lubumbashi to celebrate the first \"May Day in Free Congo\".</p><p>Zaire's second city was taken by the rebels on April 9.</p><p>lmc-bur/nb/gd gd</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP1997 AFP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3TD9-3880-0025-F39H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"907\"/><timeReceived>0116 0116</timeReceived><timeReceived>01:16 GMT gmt</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English english</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Agence France Presse presse</copyright><publicationDate month=\"05\" day=\"01\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 01, 1997 1997</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH english</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001456</classCode><className>REBELLIONS &amp; INSURGENCIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001304</classCode><className>PEACE PROCESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST00098A0</classCode><className>FOREIGN RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX002273</classCode><className>NAVAL VESSELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DD82</classCode><className>NELSON MANDELA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE000A3A2</classCode><className>THABO MBEKI</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE0009TJS</classCode><className>BILL RICHARDSON</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GX118</classCode><className>LIBREVILLE, GABON</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX006</classCode><className>LUANDA, ANGOLA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>GX299</classCode><className>JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC336</classCode><className>SOUTH AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC390</classCode><className>GABON</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC500</classCode><className>ANGOLA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC394</classCode><className>CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
