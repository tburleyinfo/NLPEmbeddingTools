Mbeki, a key mediator, was to leave for the region later today.</p><p>Publicly, South Africa and the United States - the major figures in starting the talks - are expressing optimism that Mobutu's inevitable departure from power will be achieved at Wednesday's meeting.</p><p>\"What will be formed at these peace talks is an inclusive transitional government where power is handed over in a peaceful fashion,\" the United States' U.N. ambassador, Bill Richardson, said Sunday.</p><p>But quietly these nations are preparing for the worst. The United States is set to evacuate Americans, has scaled back its embassy workers in the capital, and diplomatic staffers have put their valuables in storage in case fighting breaks out or soldiers loot the city, as they did in 1991 and 1993.</p><p>The Zairian government, too, is preparing for bloodshed, calling today on Kinshasa residents to take up arms to defend the capital and imposing a dusk-to-dawn curfew.</p><p>The inconclusive first round of talks May 4 highlighted the two leaders' intransigence.</p><p>Kabila stuck to his demand that Mobutu resign immediately and hand power to a transitional authority that he would lead; Mobutu, ailing with prostate cancer but determined to make an honorable exit, refused and said he would only hand power to an elected president.</p><p>Since then, the rebels have fought to a reported 30 miles from the capital and regular Zairians on the street appear eager to welcome Kabila's army into their dilapidated capital.</p><p>Mobutu appeared to have given Kabila the key to the city when he announced his departure last Wednesday for a three-day trip to Gabon for talks with regional presidents. Despite loud threats, Kabila didn't make his move, possibly swayed by international pressure to hold off. But he was more likely influenced by concerns his men weren't battle-ready enough to take the capital in a quick swipe with a minimum of bloodshed.</p><p>If observers were surprised by Mobutu's seemingly risky trip out of the country, many were equally surprised he came back rather than head into exile in the face of insurmountable military and political pressures.</p><p>The parliament Sunday appeared to make a move toward creating some sense of order by selecting Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo as parliamentary president to assume power in Mobutu's absence - a sign a plan was in the works for the dictator to relinquish control.</p><p>The idea presumably would be for Mobutu to hand power to a transitional authority led by the monsignor, who would then hand power to Kabila, thus sparing Mobutu the humiliation of handing over directly to the rebel chief.</p><p>But Monsengwo, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Kisangani, hasn't said he'll take the job. He's also been rejected by opposition parties and by Kabila as a pawn for Mobutu.</p><p>\"He's a politician in a bishop's robes,\" said opposition lawmaker Valentin Mubake Nombi. \"Kabila couldn't accept Monsengwo as president, even for one hour.\"</p><p>Thus, hopes are pinned on concessions by either Mobutu or Kabila when, or if, they meet again.</p><p>Mbeki didn't mince words when asked what was at stake: \"If this agreement is not reached, in reality, it opens the way to a military solution being the only thing on the cards.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-87X0-000Y-K18F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 13, 1997, Tuesday, PM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
