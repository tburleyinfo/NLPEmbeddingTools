Rebel forces entered Kinshasa, largely unopposed, a day after Mobutu fled the city Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kinshasans rushed into the streets of the city on Sunday morning after a night of violence that left at least 26 dead. Some shouted \"Liberte!\" and burned the flag they associated with nearly 32 years of Mobutu's despotic rule.</p><p>In the La Cite district - near the home of popular opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi - residents danced around the charred remains of seven soldiers killed by the rebels. Witnesses said two of the soldiers were still alive when they were set afire.</p><p>Elsewhere in the city, civilians taunted government troops who were obeying a rebel order to hand in their guns. The crowd pushed forward one man, whom the rebels took away for interrogation, beat bloody, and then executed.</p><p>\"They're going to kill me! They're going to kill me now!\" the despairing man called just before a rebel fighter shot him in the back.</p><p>It was not known who the man was or why he was executed</p><p>There were conflicting reports on the whereabouts of Mobutu himself.</p><p>Authorities at a military airport in the Moroccan capital of Rabat said Mobutu arrived there at 3 a.m. Sunday. The entourage arrived in one civilian plane and two military planes, and immediately went to a resort hotel on the sea, just south of the Moroccan capital, the authorities said on condition of anonymity.</p><p>But a Mobutu spokesman in Paris said the deposed president was still in his home village of Gbadolite in northern Zaire Sunday morning. He had fled there hours before the rebels marched into the city.</p><p>At the rebel's headquarters in Lubumbashi, the rebel alliance's finance minister, Mwana Nanga Mawampanga, said a delegation would arrive Sunday to set up a local government.</p><p>The finance minister said the alliance routinely sends a political delegation to newly-captured territory, \"to reassure the population, to explain our message.\"</p><p>When asked when rebel leader Kabila may go to Kinshasa, the minister replied, \"Very soon. In the next couple of days, or a few days … It's at his discretion.\"</p><p>U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun flew to Lubumbashi on Sunday to talk with Kabila and his officials about \"the future of Zaire.\" Sahnoun noted that the people of Kinshasa had not fought Kabila's forces, which he said showed that the people wanted Kabila's rebel alliance there.</p><p>Camp Tshatshi, the site of Mobutu's opulent palace in Kinshasa, was the site of small-arms battles through the night but by morning was in fully in rebel hands.</p><p>Some people looted the houses of generals in the camp, carrying off chairs and even books stamped 'Mobutu,' but most people trying to scavenge were shooed away by the rebels.</p><p>There was minor looting in the town overnight, with some windows smashed.</p><p>Medical staff at Kinshasa's Mama Yemo hospital struggled to treat those wounded during the night's violence. They said that 11 dead had arrived during the night.</p><p>That brought to 26 the number of known dead, mostly government soldiers shot dead by residents while looting - or residents killed by looting soldiers.</p><p>Just 60 worshipers trickled into to the 9:30 a.m. mass St. Anne, a Roman Catholic Church in downtown Kinshasa on Sunday, far fewer than usual.</p><p>\"We should ask our Lord to inhabit the hearts of those who will rule our country,\" the priest said in French in his opening prayer.</p><p>Saturday night, rebels in Zaire sent their first radio broadcast, ordering former government soldiers to turn in their weapons by Sunday, and warning looters they would be punished.</p><p>Aides to Mobutu either fled or died at the hands of their own soldiers.</p><p>Dozens of Mobutu associates sought refuge from reprisal attacks in the plush InterContinental Hotel, arriving with bags packed and trickling out during the day to flee in speedboats across the river into neighboring Congo.</p><p>They included Mobutu's son, Kongulu, a senior army officer who escaped with his family and 30 bodyguards.</p><p>Not all were so lucky. Mobutu's army chief and defense minister, Gen. Marc Mahele Lieko Bokungu, was shot by a soldier who accused him of being a traitor for advising Mobutu that Kinshasa was indefensible, and he should leave.</p><p>Kabila, from the southeastern city of Lubumbashi, declared himself president.</p><p>\"I am happy, very happy to succeed,\" he said with a broad smile.</p><p>The 56-year-old rebel leader pledged to form a transitional government by Tuesday and issue a new constitution within 60 days. But he made no mention of elections the United States has pressed him to organize.</p><p>Kabila's biggest task will be trying to reshape the country's economy, military and politics without resorting to draconian measures that could easily label him another Mobutu. While he has promised such changes, he has been short on specifics, and his troops have been accused of atrocities against Rwandan Hutu refugees in their march across Zaire.</p><p>The rebels also said they will return the country to the name it had when it first achieved independence in 1960 - the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mobutu had changed the name to Zaire in 1971.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-86C0-000Y-K3SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"891\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 18, 1997, Sunday, BC cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
