Rwanda and zaire refuse</p><p>RWANDAN government troops in uniform last night entered the eastern Zairean town of Goma, dramatically escalating the political crisis in the region where more than 1 million refugees are on the move.</p><p> Sadako Ogata, the head of the United Nations' refugee agency, fears a disaster greater than that of 1994, when about 50,000 newly-arrived Rwandan refugees died of epidemics in stinking, overcrowded camps in eastern Zaire.</p><p>Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda are all now threatened with the escalation of an ethnic war which began as two local struggles between bands from the ill-disciplined and unpaid Zairean army and longtime Tutsi residents in eastern Zaire.</p><p> Calls for a ceasefire and a regional summit by the UN, the European Union, and aid agencies working among the refugees were dismissed by the main players, Zaire and Rwanda, yesterday.</p><p> At the UN, Zaire's charge d'affaires, Lukabu Khabouji, said after the Security Council had called for an immediate ceasefire that Zaire will not attend peace talks until Rwandan soldiers had withdrawn.</p><p> Ethnic hatred spread west as far as the Zairean capital, Kinshasa, yesterday with a witchhunt against prominent Tutsis in the business community. Dozens fled to neighbouring Congo.</p><p> A mob of several hundred demonstrators attacked and looted Tutsi-owned property in the capital, stealing dozens of cars, according to a Reuters Television cameraman, Marc Hoogsteyns. \"I saw them smash the windows of two shops said to be owned by Tutsis in central Kinshasa and loot a beer truck,\" he said. \"They were driving around in dozens of stolen cars.\"</p><p>Zaire's parliament called for the expulsion of all Tutsis from the country and the breaking of relations with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda - accused of backing the Tutsi rebellion.</p><p> In eastern Zaire, witnesses on the Rwanda-Zaire border at Gisenyi said mortars were fired first from the Zairean side of the border. Thousands of people fled in panic and Rwandan troops began to return fire.</p><p> In Goma, the base for aid agencies feeding more than 1 million Rwandan Hutus and their families since they fled after the genocide in 1994, foreign residents cowered in their homes. Civilians streamed out of the town as Zairean troops looted it before the Rwandan army arrived by boat over the lake and heavy fighting erupted.</p><p> Last night, Tutsi rebels were battling for control of Goma's airport, and the Medecins sans Frontieres aid charity said 100 aid workers, including six of its staff, had been stranded by the fighting.</p><p> Further south, the Zairean army was finally routed in the town of Bukavu.  Heavily armed uniformed Tutsi rebels took control and civilians began to trickle back yesterday, according to a Reuter journalist, Corinne Dufka, who had been trapped inside the town for two days.</p><p> They were well-disciplined, well-organised and set up checkpoints throughout the town, she reported. Rebel commanders said they are Zairean and speak a variety of languages including Swahili, Lingala, French and English.</p><p> Ms Dufka's account contradicted the claim by Zaire's prime minister, Leon Kengo Wa Dondo, that Bukavu was back under government control. He also claimed control of nearby Uvira.</p><p> Yesterday in Uvira, the scene of an early success by the Tutsi rebels, the leader of the rebellion, Laurent Kabila, claimed the war was a battle for the soul of all Zaire.</p><p> Mr Kabila, wearing a safari suit, sat in his rebel headquarters, the front room of which passes for a grand house in Uvira - one of the first towns he seized after launching his offensive two weeks ago.</p><p> \"Our objectives are clear,\" he said. \"We are fighting for a vast movement to put an end to this useless state that no longer exists.</p><p> \"There is no power at the top. We want to overthrow the irresponsible clique of people in power to put in place a transitional government which would eventually organise democratic elections.\"</p><p> Mr Kabila heads the \"Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo -Zaire\" - his supporters are keen to point out the significance of the name.</p><p> This not only claims to be a national movement, but one that harks back to before President Mobutu Sese Seko changed the country's name.</p><p> Mr Kabila insists it is not a movement merely born of a backlash by Zaire's Banyamulenge Tutsis against increasingly vicious persecution by their own government and Hutu refugees from Burundi and Rwanda.</p><p> At his headquarters, Mr Kabila introduced other rebel leaders, including one with a cellular phone hooked up to neighbouring Burundi.</p><p>France has added its voice to those accusing Rwanda of backing the rebellion, but Mr Kabila denies receiving any foreign assistance.</p><p> There are hints otherwise. Some of his troops wear the Rwandan army's familiar Wellington boots, rarely seen among other soldiers in the region.</p><p> In contrast with the disciplined force reported to have taken Bukavu, the rebel soldiers in Uvira were not impressive. There was the usual guerrilla mismatch of uniforms.</p><p> With the pendulum of military control appearing to swing in favour of the rebels, confusion and panic among the refugees mounted.</p><p> \"At one point yesterday we had refugees on the road walking in both directions,\" said Panos Moumtzis, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Goma. \"They are really panicking. They are very scared. They do not know where to go.\"</p><p> UN officials and foreign aid workers said already appalling conditions in the refugee camps - including Mugunga, with an estimated 500,000 people - were worsening. Food and water shortages are compounded by a growing public health problem - and terror.</p><p> A UNHCR spokeswoman, Ruth Marshall, reported continuing attacks by Tutsis on refugee camps in eastern Zaire, provoking panic in terrible conditions. \"People are slopping around in shit - it is heading towards catastrophe,\" she said.</p><p> More than 100,000 refugees and local Zairean residents were making their way south from Kahindo to Mugunga camp. The camp is out of the control of the international agencies. Bodies are regularly found; guns and grenades can be bought with ease; and the majority of refugees are kept in a state of fear by the killers to prevent them returning to Rwanda.</p><p> Nearly 200,000 refugees were yesterday making their way to Mugunga after their camp at Kibumba had been attacked and burnt by Banyamulenge forces.</p><p> Ian Bray, Oxfam's spokesman, described the situation as \"basically, mayhem\".  Thousands of refugees were moving west into Zaire but aid workers were unable to keep track of them.</p><p> Some were moving north towards Goma, others who had been attacked by Tutsis were moving south of Uvira towards the Fizi Plain. But, Mr Bray added, \"no one really knows where people are going\".</p><p> Oxfam issued a statement saying the Geneva Convention on behaviour in war was being torn up in Zaire and told the international community that central Africa was heading for a \"firestorm of instability\".</p><p> Oxfam accused politicians of \"failing to do their job\" and of using the huge humanitarian effort in the area triggered by the previous Rwandan crisis as a substitute for political action.</p><p> * EU ministers have been invited to meet in Brussels next Thursday to discuss emergency humanitarian support for the refugees caught in the fighting in eastern Zaire, the current holder of the EU presidency, Ireland, said yesterday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN1996</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3TDG-WH10-006X-B28G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"2507\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Guardian (London)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1996 Guardian Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationDate month=\"11\" day=\"02\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>November 2, 1996</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>UNITED NATIONS  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className> UNITED NATIONS </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className> EUROPEAN UNION  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className> EUROPEAN UNION </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>UNITED NATIONS  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className> UNITED NATIONS </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className> EUROPEAN UNION  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className> EUROPEAN UNION </className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>UNITED NATIONS  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className> UNITED NATIONS </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className> EUROPEAN UNION  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className> EUROPEAN UNION </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Eligibility for Refugee Status</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjFFMzM2M0FCN0QyNDM0QTgzQzQyRTkzRkVBOTg5MzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUM5ODIzNEVDM0VCNDU1OTkyMDZCRUU1Q0ZCMzM4NDM</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUUyNzg3Nzk1NDk5NDEzOEJCQzdBM0VEMEI3QTg2NjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUM5ODIzNEVDM0VCNDU1OTkyMDZCRUU1Q0ZCMzM4NDM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001461</classCode><className>REFUGEES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUM5ODIzNEVDM0VCNDU1OTkyMDZCRUU1Q0ZCMzM4NDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0VDRDc0NDNBMjkwNDJBMEFCOUNGMTU1QzFBRTIyMTk</classCode><className>Refugee Status</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp;
