He said South African officials would be presenting him with a security report Saturday and that he would determine whether to meet President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p><p>Furthermore, the rebel leader claimed, he wasn't even issued a formal invitation to the talks.</p><p>''I wasn't invited,'' Kabila said. ''I heard it on the radio, but I got no official invitation.''</p><p>Kabila's apparent stalling tactic came a day after Mobutu himself hedged on attending the summit, failing to show up at the airport for a flight to the talks. Zairian officials Thursday blamed the delay on logistical problems.</p><p>Mobutu grudgingly flew to Congo and boarded the South African naval ship on Friday and the SAS Outeniqua set sail for international waters off of Angola. South African President Nelson Mandela and other officials were on board the ship to preside over the talks.</p><p>South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who was supposed to escort Kabila from Angola to the talks, flew to the ship Friday night carrying a message from Kabila. The ship later returned to the Congo port.</p><p>The international diplomats who have brokered the peace talks, the first face-to-face showdown between the two rivals, know the summit may be the last chance to prevent the rebels from taking the capital. Rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire are only 400 kilometers (250 miles) from Kinshasa and have said they will storm the capital if Mobutu does not step down.</p><p>Kabila said Friday night that he would go to the talks only to negotiate ''Mobutu's exit and the handover of power to the Alliance.''</p><p>Otherwise, he said, rebel forces would take the rest of Zaire within two weeks.</p><p>Kabila claimed that Zairian government forces had been reduced to 11 percent of their original strength.</p><p>He also said accusations of rebel atrocities against some of the 80,000 Rwandan refugees in central Zaire were ''a political setup to prevent the Alliance rising to full power and to tarnish my character.''</p><p>U.N. investigators in Geneva said Friday they would leave this weekend to check into alleged massacres of the the Rwandan Hutu refugees by the rebels, even though the rebels have so far refused to permit the visit.</p><p>U.N. officials said the rebels had held up approval because Roberto Garreton of Chile would be one of the investigators. He has reported to the U.N. Human Rights Commission that that he marked 40 locations in rebel-held eastern Zaire where he believed there were mass graves.</p><p>He cited accounts of graves containing anywhere from a few hundred to 50,000 corpses, but said he had no idea of the true number of victims.</p><p>Earlier in the day, officials gathered in this port city were uncertain up to the last minute whether Mobutu would board the SAS Outeniqua. The ailing president had refused to take a helicopter to the boat, saying the vibrations would be bad for his cancer-ridden body.</p><p>Five hours later, a plank was lowered from the ship and Mobutu was driven aboard a side portal of the naval vessel.</p><p>When asked whether Mobutu was there to announce he would step down from his nearly 32 years in power, Mobutu's chief of staff Felix Vunduwe, said, ''No. Why should he?''</p><p>''They have come to obtain a cease-fire and to obtain a precise framework for negotiations about the transition process,'' Vunduwe said.</p><p>The ship set sail into the Atlantic Ocean, headed toward Angola, at about 5:20 p.m. (1620 GMT).</p><p>U.S. envoy Bill Richardson, who has been in the region since Monday helping to broker the peace talks, said before boarding the ship Friday that ''the main elements of any agreement will be dealt with by the Zairians themselves.''</p><p>''In my view, this meeting will produce a process that involves a transfer of power and hopefully a transitional, inclusive government,'' added Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p>Mandela was also optimistic about the talks.</p><p>''I am confident the two leaders realize the importance of a peaceful settlement,'' he said. ''I know few leaders who have made military gains and nevertheless been committed to peace as Mr.  Kabila has.''</p><p>The talks were to be held in a windowless, air-conditioned container aboard the ship, presided over by Mandela and U.N.  special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun.</p><p>Mobutu, 66, has insisted he would never bow to Kabila's demand to resign, but he is seriously ill with prostate cancer and the international pressure to step down may force him to do so.</p><p>The United States and other countries want a cease-fire in Zaire's civil war, the establishment of a transitional government that includes rebels and opposition parties, and a plan for free, fair elections.</p><p>(bdb)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3RY4-5F60-00BT-M35V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><timeReceived>17:37 Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 02, 1997;
