They already control more than a third of the country, mostly in the east, and have encountered little resistance in their quest to topple the president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the prospect of civil war coming to Kinshasa, about 1,300 Marines and other U.S. forces were \"at a very high state of awareness and preparedness,\" set to evacuate hundreds of U.S. citizens if necessary, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday in Washington.</p><p>\"The Marines â€¦ are standing by and at the ready in the event that they are called upon to help out,\" Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday said.</p><p>There are about 500 Americans in Zaire, 320 of them in the capital.</p><p>Meanwhile, an increasingly isolated Mobutu - abandoned by such longtime supporters as the United States and Belgium, its former colonial ruler - has turned to the military to salvage his long and corrosive rule.</p><p>Today, France - a longtime Mobutu ally - suggested the embattled president meet with Kabila. Such a meeting would be contribute to \"facilitating a peaceful solution,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt. That is the closest France has come to suggesting Mobutu's days are numbered.</p><p>Likulia Bolongo, an old army buddy of Mobutu, wore his general's uniform and was saluted by his guards Thursday as he left his luxurious Kinshasa home for his first meeting with the president since being made premier.</p><p>Likulia today is expected to present 25 new Cabinet ministers for approval by Mobutu. Defense Ministry spokesman Leon Kalima said 10 posts will go to Mobutu supporters, 10 to the camp of ousted Prime Minister Leon Kengo wa Dondo, three to military officers and two to civic leaders.</p><p>Kengo was Mobutu's handpicked prime minister, but he was blamed for the army's losses to eastern rebels, and Mobutu was forced to fire him two weeks ago and replace him with the popular opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi.</p><p>Likulia replaces Tshisekedi, whom Mobutu cronies blocked from taking his seat as premier Wednesday. The move, coming after Mobutu had given into domestic and international pressure and appointed Tshisekedi, angered the president's overseas allies.</p><p>\"Mobutuism has no future, and now we have to see how to get to a transitional government,\" Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said in Brussels.</p><p>The White House called Thursday for rebel-government negotiations on a transitional government.</p><p>Zairian government negotiators left South Africa today after another round of consultations with rebel delegates and U.N. officials. With Kabila's ultimatum, the talks lost any momentum gained by Tuesday's agreement to work for a cease-fire.</p><p>A senior aide to Tshisekedi promised further resistance, and said the Tshisekedi administration - which considers itself Zaire's legitimate government - would seek to try Mobutu for high treason.</p><p>Joseph Yaone said Tshisekedi's path would continue to be non-violent. \"We don't have to prove ourselves against barbarians.\"</p><p>Likulia's convoy arrived at Mobutu's heavily guarded palace, overlooking the rapids of the Zaire River, just as a bugle call marked the noon hour.</p><p>The pomp recalled Mobutu's rise to power in 1965, when the United States and Belgium saw the eager and capable young colonel as the key to stabilizing Zaire and thwarting Soviet expansion in the region. The friendship faded with the end of the Cold War and Mobutu's mismanagement of Zaire's mineral-rich land.</p><p>The Belgian and U.S. ambassadors met with Likulia on Thursday.</p><p>\"I think that this country needs, very badly, change,\" U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson said afterward. \"What you need is responsible elected government.\"</p><p>The rebels said they were approaching Kinshasa and called on foreigners to evacuate the capital, according to a radio report monitored in nearby Gabon. Diplomats in Kinshasa said they were not taking the warning seriously.</p><p>Doubleday said the Marines are on board the amphibious warship USS Nassau off the coast of Zaire. There also are U.S. troops in Brazzaville, Congo, across the river from Kinshasa, and in Libreville, Gabon, who would help in an airlift from the region.</p><p>In the east, the United Nations today flew 200 displaced Zairians to Goma from Kisangani - where at least 40,000 Zairians displaced by advancing rebels have landed.</p><p>The evacuation was a test run for an proposed airlift of tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees, who fled to Zaire in 1994 after extremists among them slaughtered at least 500,000 minority Tutsis. Though most of the Rwandan refugees have returned home, some fled deeper into Zaire's jungle.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-8N60-000Y-K0V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated PressÂ  All Rights ReservedÂ  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>April 11, 1997, Friday, PM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
