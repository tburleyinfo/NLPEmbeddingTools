He is said to be going to Morocco and from there possibly to France to live in exile.</p><p>Kabila, 56, renamed Zaire the Democratic Republic of Congo, reverting to the title used after independence from Belgium in 1960 and before Mobutu renamed the sprawling, mineral-rich country in 1971.</p><p>\"I am happy, very happy to succeed,'' Kabila beamed at rebel headquarters in the southeastern mining town of Lubumbashi.</p><p>Brimming with confidence, Kabila announced a nine-point \"power-taking declaration'' that named him as president.</p><p>\"Laurent Desire Kabila assumes from today the functions of head of state,'' he said, reading a statement from his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo.</p><p>Rebel leaders made the decision Friday, he said, to avoid a power vacuum that could bring conflict and bloodshed.</p><p>Kabila, who has fought to oust Mobutu for 32 years, said he would form \"a transitional government of national salvation'' within three days, and would convene an assembly within 60 days to write a new constitution. He did not mention elections, which he previously has promised within a year of taking power.</p><p>Kabila said he talked by telephone with Mobutu's generals, and \"everyone was ready to receive orders from me, it is clear.''</p><p>Senior officials of Mobutu's government were advised to continue in their posts. But many, including Prime Minister Gen. Likulia Bolongo, fled.</p><p>Kabila's forces swiftly captured Kinshasa as they did the rest of the country in the past eight months - with little resistance. Some of Mobutu's soldiers heeded orders to surrender arms to the rebels. Some generals and politicians fled across the Zaire River to Brazzaville, Congo.</p><p>The new leader was expected to arrive in the capital from his southern headquarters at Lubumbashi in the next few days, rebel sources said.</p><p>\"The war is over,'' said Bizima Karaha, rebel foreign minister. \"It is the end of one of the worst dictatorships that humanity has ever experienced.</p><p>\"The issue now is how to reconstruct our country, how to build a democracy, and a better life for all of our country.''</p><p>Among Kabila's challenges will be convincing the country's 40 million people and more than 250 tribes, among Africa's most ethnically and politically fractious, that the alliance is a nationwide movement.</p><p>Rebels entered the radio station in Kinshasa unopposed, and in their first radio broadcast, ordered defeated government troops to report by this morning and warned looters they would be severely punished.</p><p>Witnesses in the wealthy Binza district had reported looting by residents from a neighboring shantytown before the rebels arrived.</p><p>Earlier, sporadic shooting rang out in parts of the city of five million, but France, one of five Western countries with troops across the river in Congo, said there were no plans to evacuate foreign nationals. There are about 400 Canadians in Zaire.</p><p>Kabila urged calm in Kinshasa, and warned that anyone who harms Zairians or foreigners would be dealt with severely.</p><p>The main rebel force was setting up camp at the football stadium, where about 1,000 men had assembled by late afternoon.</p><p>The United States welcomed the relatively smooth transfer of power and called on the new leadership to establish an inclusive transitional government leading to elections.</p><p>France, which for decades propped up Mobutu's regime, expressed displeasure that a negotiated solution hadn't been reached.</p><p>Earlier, a diplomat said presidential guards from Mobutu's Nbgandi tribe killed defence minister and army chief of staff Gen. Mahele Lieko Bokungo on Friday night. Diplomats said Mahele had been planning to meet Kabila to discuss handing over power.</p><p>Kabila and his rebels took up arms in October in a dispute over Zairian nationality for ethnic Tutsis.</p><p>The rebel leader said he was unconcerned about Mobutu's future. \"He can stay in his village, but I think it is not very important at all,'' he said.</p><p>Mobutu, with whom France had a close relationship for decades, has a villa on the French Riviera, but it was not clear if he would go to France to live in exile. Diplomats in Rabat, Morocco, where Mobutu also has a lavish home, have said they expect him to arrive there soon.</p><p>Mobutu was expected in Morocco on Saturday night, and then would travel to Lichtenstein several hours later, a Moroccan government official said.</p><p>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mobutu would stay in Lichtenstein until after the French legislative elections, at which point he would settle into exile in France.</p><p>Asked Friday whether France would receive Mobutu, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt would say only: \"It is speculation since we don't know the intentions of Mr. Mobutu.''</p><p>Switzerland moved to block all assets Mobutu holds there. He is reputed to have amassed a huge personal fortune over the years.</p><p>For years, Western powers supported Mobutu as a Cold War bastion against Soviet communism.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199705170084</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4706-3630-01G6-81G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 17, 1997 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
