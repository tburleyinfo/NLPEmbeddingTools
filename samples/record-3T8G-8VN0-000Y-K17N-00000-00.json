Kabila has fed the fears by establishing strict rule over pieces of Zaire as he captures them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'm afraid of what happened after we got independence in 1960,\" said Paul Kapinda, an unemployed economist who was born the same year the Belgian colonial leaders left. \"We were promised democracy, but we got a dictator. Will Kabila be another Mobutu?\"</p><p>Whether Kabila can lead a country, not just a rebellion, becomes a more pressing issue as President Mobutu Sese Seko's health deteriorates and his government collapses.</p><p>\"Mobutu was a military man; we don't need another one as president,\" said Claude Otshudi, a psychology student at the University of Kisangani. \"We want a civilian as president.\"</p><p>Kabila, 56, clearly enjoys the power he now yields. Sometimes he says he will be president of Zaire, but only for a short time and only if the people want him. Other times he says he wants to win the revolution, then retire to private life.</p><p>Sometimes his actions contradict his words.</p><p>Last week, Kabila banned all political parties but his own. He said it was a temporary measure to prevent Mobutu from stopping the advance of his troops, who are about 125 miles from Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city.</p><p>A transitional government will be formed exclusively by the rebels' Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, he said.</p><p>\"We are in the process of liberation. If we accept political parties, they will tell lies to stop the advance of the Alliance,\" Kabila said. \"We can't accept this distraction in the face of an enemy.\"</p><p>Kabila's friend, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, similarly banned political parties when he led a coup there in 1986. More than a decade later, the ban remains.</p><p>No one complained, at least not openly, about Kabila's ruling.</p><p>\"We're all part of the Alliance now,\" said Eric Joseph Lunganga, vice president of the Democratic Union for Social Progress, the main opposition party led by Etienne Tshisekedi.</p><p>Perhaps Lunganga was untroubled because his party members and supporters swept the \"election\" that was held in Kisangani after the rebels captured the strategic city on the Zaire River in mid-March.</p><p>Swiftly installing a civilian administration in each bit of captured territory seems to be a rebel strategy to come across as liberators rather than conquerors.</p><p>With a show of hands at a soccer stadium, Democratic Union president Yaghi Sitolo was elected governor, a sign of the party's strong organization on the ground, compared to the Alliance's.</p><p>When Kabila's savvy young \"Cabinet ministers\" arrived last week in Kisangani, they immediately set about trying to persuade residents to be for the Alliance, not just against Mobutu.</p><p>They met with businessmen, politicians and religious leaders, and they didn't balk at awkward questions such as, \"What makes Kabila any better than Mobutu?\"</p><p>\"A few days ago you couldn't walk the streets without government soldiers robbing you,\" said the rebels' self-proclaimed justice minister, Mwenze Kongolo.</p><p>\"Our soldiers don't steal. They buy what they want. Before we came, there was a curfew, you couldn't even sit out on your own porch at night. President Mobutu didn't let you vote for your own leaders. We will.\"</p><p>There were other, smaller signs that the rebels are trying to be different.</p><p>They paid civilian truck drivers for hauling troops and munition to Kisangani, handing over huge stacks of bank notes bearing Mobutu's likeness, each stack worth about $ 200. The Zairian government pays its soldiers $ 1 a month, if at all.</p><p>Rebel soldiers are widely viewed here as outsiders. Most are Banyamulenge, Tutsis of Rwandan descent from the eastern border area of Zaire.</p><p>\"This is what I tell people, it's time that the dream of Martin Luther King comes true, even in this country,\" said the rebel finance minister, Mwamana Nanga Mawampanga.</p><p>\"We try to explain to people, don't look at us or these young soldiers from where they come, or which language they speak or which ethnic group they are, but by what they are doing. These kids are out there 24 hours a day to protect you and your freedom.\"</p><p>In this vast, mineral-rich country of more than 200 tribes, most people say they will support any government that allows them to live in peace and prosperity, regardless of its ethnic composition.</p><p>\"Mobutu treated his tribe like royalty. He saved the best for his brothers,\" said PiliPili Mukobelwa, a Bukavu taxi driver. \"Kabila … has a chance to do things right. If he has good ideas, and he does, people will follow him.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-8VN0-000Y-K17N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"795\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>March 25, 1997, Tuesday, AM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X9C</classCode><className>GOVERNORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940GM</classCode><className>POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Governments</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000420</classCode><className>COUPS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000303</classCode><className>CIVIL SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0M2RDE1RTlBNDk4NDkxRDlBMTkwQ0JCNERDNTA5NUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM1OUEyRDNERTdENEU2MTk3RTlCNEJCRUY0NjRGRjQ</classCode><className>Armed Forces</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N813930MM</classCode><className>LABOR UNIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009SE3</classCode><className>STADIUMS &amp; ARENAS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0M2RDE1RTlBNDk4NDkxRDlBMTkwQ0JCNERDNTA5NUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM1OUEyRDNERTdENEU2MTk3RTlCNEJCRUY0NjRGRjQ</classCode><className>Armed Forces</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DL3I</classCode><className>YOWERI MUSEVENI</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC394</classCode><className>CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC563</classCode><className>UGANDA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
