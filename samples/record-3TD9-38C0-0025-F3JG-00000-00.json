His democratic credentials remain in doubt and many Africa analysts here say he does not have the stature to handle the affairs of state.</p><p>Reports of refugee massacres by members of Kabila's alliance and Kabila's announcement that he was giving UN and aid workers 60 days in which to repatriate all the refugees have also tarnished the rebel leader's reputation.</p><p>Beyond the internal challenges, the United States sees international and domestic implications to the worsening conflict in Zaire.</p><p>Without strong US engagement at this juncture, the conflict may spill over into other nations, opening the prospect of a military intervention in central Africa that Washington wants to avoid at all cost.</p><p>The rebels claimed on Tuesday to have captured the town of Kikwit, 450 kilometres (280 miles) east of Kinsahsa, the capital's last line of defence.</p><p>The fall of Kikwit would be a serious blow to Mobutu's beleaguered regime since the town lies on a strategic road junction and is a centre for food deliveries to the capital.</p><p>Meanwhile efforts to bring aid to tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees in the area of Kisangani in northeastern Zaire saw some success on Tuesday as humanitarian organisations managed to push through 10 tonnes of aid for the first time in a week to refugees at Biaro camp about 40 kilometres (25 miles) south of Kisangani.</p><p>bur/jb jb</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP1997 AFP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3TD9-38C0-0025-F3JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1107\"/><timeReceived>3004 3004</timeReceived><timeReceived>30:04 GMT gmt</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English english</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Agence France Presse presse</copyright><publicationDate month=\"04\" day=\"30\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>April 30, 1997 1997</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH english</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;
