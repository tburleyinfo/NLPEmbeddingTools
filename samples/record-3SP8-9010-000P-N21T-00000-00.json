Many of them are women and children already sick and severely weakened by months of travel across the Zairian jungle,</p><p>Rebels who advanced on the camp from the direction of the town of Walikale are said to include substantial numbers of Rwandan Tutsi fighters who have enlisted to help the war effort of the Zairian rebel leader, Laurent Kabila. Diplomats and human rights advocates here described the Rwandan Tutsi as volunteers bent on revenge for the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi by Hutu in Rwanda in 1994.</p><p>Western diplomats say that as many as 1,000 Hutu fighters from the former Rwandan Army and Hutu militias have lived interspersed with the Tingi Tingi refugees, and fighting between the rival Rwandan elements is believed to have been intense.</p><p>\"The thesis of these Tutsi is that all of these Hutu are interahamwe,\" or members of the Hutu militia that organized the 1994 massacre, said Guillaume Ngefa Atondo, president of the Zairian Human Rights Association. \"The geography of the fighting indicates a determination to exterminate refugees.\"</p><p>The Zairian Government has accused the rebels of having massacred as many as 25,000 Hutu refugees in recent days. Diplomats and aid workers discount that figure, but say the fate of the refugees is endangered by the uncertainty over whether there will be any relief workers left to help them, after some agencies withdrew workers and the Zairian Government expelled others.</p><p>Zaire's war began in October, when persecuted Zairian ethnic Tutsi began an uprising in the eastern border region, an assault that diplomats say was strongly supported by Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.</p><p>In addition to persecuting its own Tutsi minority, who were stripped of their Zairian nationality, Zaire had earned the animosity of its eastern neighbors by allowing Hutu militiamen to mount attacks on Rwanda and Burundi from huge refugee camps in Zaire's east.</p><p>The rebels' first goal seemed to be breaking up the refugee camps, and pursuing fighters they considered to be Hutu war criminals. But as Government forces collapsed, the leader of the rebellion, Mr. Kabila, a lifelong opponent of Mr. Mobutu, set out to overthrow the Government outright.</p><p>After weeks during which empty Government declarations of counterattacks and the recapture of fallen positions have become routine, there is now a numbed silence among officials here who seem to sense that the end is nearing.</p><p>Asked for information about new developments in the war, one senior official said: \"Is there any news today? Give us a break, we need time to digest the loss of Kindu.\"</p><p>After being pillaged by the army, Kindu, a strategic city on the Zaire River 360 miles west of the borders with Rwanda and Burundi, was captured by the rebels last weekend, depriving Government forces of the last remaining airfield from which it could attack the eastern border zones that have been the rebel strongholds.</p><p>The speed of the rebels' most recent advances, coming after a lull in the war that followed a series of bombing runs by Government aircraft, seems to have taken even close observers of the military situation here by surprise.</p><p>As the noose has tightened around Kisangani, rebels have advanced on three fronts, overcoming Zaire's famously bad road network and reportedly carrying their own planks to span the damaged bridges that abound in the rainforest.</p><p>In their most stunning maneuver so far, a rebel group with a strength estimated at 200 to 300 men reached the town of Bengamisa this week, about 25 miles north of Kisangani, overcoming the lack of roads by traveling by canoe down the Lindi River more than 100 miles from the recently fallen town of Bafwasende.</p><p>The execution of plans like that one has reinforced two impressions about the rebels.</p><p>The first is that they are not, or are no longer, primarily made up of the Zairian Tutsi from the eastern part of the country who were at the root of the revolt. Everywhere the rebels have traveled, their numbers have swollen, as has their knowledge of the local terrain.</p><p>Second, military analysts say, the unidentified commander in charge of the rebel campaign, whether Zairian, or more likely Rwandan or Ugandan, is a well-schooled officer and masterful strategist.</p><p>\"There is an Eisenhower or Montgomery type putting this together: very cautious, very methodical, and very impressive,\" said one Western military expert. \"The approach by river to Kisangani is just one example. It completely cuts off retreat by the Zairian Army.\"</p><p>That fact does not seem to have escaped Zairian forces in Kisangani, a faded diamond-trading center and important Zaire River port that has been battered repeatedly by past army pillages.</p><p>Residents of the city reached by telephone say tensions are already running extremely high, with soldiers placing their families on flights out of the city and warning merchants of imminent pillage.</p><p>What makes Kisangani different from all other cities captured by the rebels so far, beyond its size and political importance, is that from the start it has been the center of the Government's war effort, and as such is a major depot for arms and ammunition that would fall into rebel hands along with the city.</p><p>Kisangani is also the base of 200 to 300 foreign mercenaries, including Serbs, Russians and Ukrainians.</p><p>The mercenaries have stepped up their activities in recent days, mining approaches to the city and flying ground-attack practice runs in Russian-built helicopters. At the same time, Serbian mercenary pilots have flown the country's three leased fighter jets out of Kisangani as a precaution against their loss, reportedly stationing them in the diamond-producing city of Mbuji Mayi.</p><p>\"If Kisangani falls, things will get ugly for the Government,\" said Christophe Gbenye, a rebel leader of the 1960's who held the city for five months in 1964. \"It is a whole reign that is passing, and for Mobutu it looks like an exit without glory.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Rebel forces have advanced quickly toward Kisangani, the unofficial capital of eastern Zaire, after overrunning the city of Kindu, where an armored vehicle was abandoned by the Zairian Army on Sunday.
