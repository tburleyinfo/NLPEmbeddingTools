The rebels also seized Bandundu, 300 kilometres northwest of the capital, maintaining the advance on two fronts.</p><p>Secondly, Mobutu agreed at Thursday's Libreville summit not to stand again in presidential elections. He had not previously been so explicit.</p><p>However, the rebels have said they will not accept power being handed to an interim head of state other than Kabila himself.</p><p>It dampened hopes that the Archbishop of Kisangani, Monsignor Laurent Mosengwo, could resume a former post as president of the transitional parliament, a position which would make him Zaire's interim leader under the constitution if Mobutu resigned.</p><p>Rebel foreign affairs spokesman Bizima Karaha however rejected the prospect of a parliamentary speaker taking over.</p><p>\"The transition will be undertaken by the (rebel) Alliance and nobody but the Alliance,\" Karaha said. Once in power, the Alliance would be open to other opposition politicians.</p><p>US envoy Bill Richardson expressed cautious optimism Friday that a peaceful transition could be achieved, with Kabila at the head of a transitional government.</p><p>Richardson, who brokered the first Mobutu-Kabila meeting, told US public television: \"I do believe there's still a good chance of a peaceful, inclusive transition government.\"</p><p>He called Kabila \"street smart\" and \"pragmatic,\" but said the president was \"not facing reality\" because his advisors were not telling him the truth about the pitiful state of his forces.</p><p>Richardson added: \"I believe that Mobutu is now realistic; he's a dignified person; he wants to go out gracefully.\"</p><p>West of Kenge, government troops and rebels were locked in what appeared to be one of the biggest battles of nearly seven months of civil war.</p><p>Zairean Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba said Friday that the government forces were holding a line on the Wamba river west of Kenge, but Karaha claimed the rebels were 50 kilometres to the west.</p><p>Hundreds of people are feared to have died in the fighting for Kenge, one of the first times the Zairean army has put up serious resistance against rebels who have seized two thirds of Africa's third largest country.</p><p>km/rom</p><p>Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko will
