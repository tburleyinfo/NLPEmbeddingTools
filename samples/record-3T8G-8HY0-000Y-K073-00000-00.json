And Mobutu's presidential guards are smuggling their families out of town under cover of darkness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With half the country in rebel hands and opposition to Mobutu gaining momentum, the questions in the capital may have changed: It's no longer whether the rebels will reach Kinshasa, but when. And, will it be soon enough to forestall an uprising by soldiers and civilians demanding an end to more than 31 years of bullying and corrupt rule.</p><p>In public, Mobutu and his backers still perform as if there are battles left for them to fight in a war that most political observers say was lost long ago. A \"major government communique\" read on state-run TV Thursday night denounced an American company's billion-dollar deal to mine copper, cobalt and zinc in rebel-held territory and declared it \"null and void.\"</p><p>Never mind that the government itself is null and void in that part of Zaire and that its word its credibility is in as much jeopardy as the national currency, now trading at 175,000 to the U.S. dollar.</p><p>The question is whether the cancer-ridden Mobutu, despite his efforts to appear in control, has accepted the reality and is prepared to negotiate his exit before rebel leader Laurent Kabila comes to town.</p><p>\"He has no choice. He has no army. He has lost the support of the people, There's no money left in the state treasury,\" said Jose Zola Kinkela, secretary-general of the Independent Democratic Union party. \"Kabila will take the country - there's no doubt about it.\"</p><p>Mobutu's best move, say Zola and others, would be to salvage what honor he has left by retiring into foreign exile before he and those linked to his regime are forced to flee.</p><p>That could involve announcing he will not contest long-promised presidential elections in exchange for Kabila halting his advance on Kinshasa and accepting a transitional government until voting takes place. Despite Kabila's war talk, international persuasion could force him to accept such a scenario, said Valentin Mubake Nombi, an opposition lawmaker who attended negotiations in South Africa last month between government and rebel envoys.</p><p>\"I think Mr. Kabila has to stop now, because although he's a war chief, he also wants to govern this country. To do this, he has to win over the public opinion, and to do this he has to act as a politician, not a dictator,\" said Mubake. \"The last thing Zairians want is another Mobutu, and the last thing the international community will accept is another Mobutu.\"</p><p>If the 66-year-old ruler refuses to go voluntarily, Western diplomats say he and his confidantes surely will be forced to make a humiliating flight as Kabila closes in. Or Mobutu may die of his disease, an option the stubborn dictator might prefer. In 1991, when international pressure and public discontent forced him to introduce political reforms, he vowed never to be the ex-president of Zaire - only the late president.</p><p>Kabila claims he'll take Kinshasa within three weeks, which Western diplomats say is reasonable given his army's rate of progress and the momentum it builds by attracting new recruits along the way. Many of the recruits are youngsters with no battlefield training, but others are ex-Zairian soldiers who have changed sides.</p><p>Reports Friday had the rebel vanguard approaching Kikwit, a city some 240 miles southeast of the capital. The rutted roads have deteriorated like most of the country's infrastructure under Mobutu, and the rainy season has left some stretches impassable. But the rebels have so far tackled such terrain in tanks and trucks during during their seven-month march toward Kinshasa.</p><p>Estimates of Kabila's strength range from 6,000 men to more than twice that, with about one-third comprised of former government troops. On the government side, the numbers are higher - at least 10,000 to 15,000 in the capital alone - but it's an army with no reason to fight.</p><p>Poorly paid, equipped and trained for the last decade, Zaire's soldiers are as eager for Mobutu's ouster as civilians. Rather than battling Kabila's men, the army for the most part has looted and retreated, or joined the rebels.</p><p>Despite rumors that the airport is mined, that Mobutu has issued a hit-list of political enemies and that he has raised a red flag outside his palace to represent the blood he wants to see shed, there's a sense that Kinshasa's fall will be relatively calm and that the only people with anything to fear are those close to Mobutu.</p><p>Diplomats say they've been swamped with visa applications from the pro-Mobutu elite, many of whom apply to several embassies at once.</p><p>Most dependents of U.S., South African and other embassy personnel left voluntarily in recent days.</p><p>The despair that sparked major uprisings in 1991 and 1993, which included attacks on foreigners, is not there this time, say Kinshasa residents who witnessed the upheavals.</p><p>Rather than seeing the future as hopeless, they say, most soldiers and civilians are glad to see Mobutu's stranglehold on the country drawing to a close - and they're looking forward to whatever comes next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-8HY0-000Y-K073-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"04\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>April 20, 1997, Sunday, AM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
