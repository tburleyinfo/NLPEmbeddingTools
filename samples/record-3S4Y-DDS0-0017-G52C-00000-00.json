As we said in the headlines, Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko, the head of state, has yet again extended the ultimatum by 48 hours. The deadline is now Monday 23rd December 1996, 1300 hours, Eastern time [1100 gmt]. In the event of failure, the head of state will assume his responsibilities.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>Source: Radio Candip, Bunia, in French 0445 gmt 23 Dec 96</p></bodyText></section><p>The two political families, the presidential coalition [French: mouvance presidentiel] and the Radical Sacred Opposition Union, have not managed to agree on the formation of a government of national unity. Meanwhile, Mr [Leon] Kengo [wa Dondo] [the current prime minister] is opposed because of the current degradation of the whole situation. A motion of no-confidence to boot him out has been passed (?to that effect) because he had been elected by the transitional government [sentence as heard].</p><p>Nominations for prime minister are the responsibility of the political family which is not that of the head of state, namely the opposition. There are suspicions within the opposition itself, among the rivals. Each suspects the other. The residence of Kibasa Maliba was stoned last weekend because of divergences within the opposition. All this has not promoted discussions [word indistinct], which brought about the extension of the ultimatum, as we said earlier.</p><p>The people, who are already pleased at the restructuring of the Zairean armed forces, await the decision of the head of state, and indeed of the political class, so that the head of state can meet their expectations. As he said in his speech on his arrival in the country, he knows that the people anticipate that he will respond to these swiftly and positively. The people expect a credible head of government who enjoys the support of the people as a whole and understands the current multidimensional crisis. We await the response of the political class in the next few hours.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCSWB1996</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3S4Y-DDS0-0017-G52C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10962</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"350\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>BBC Summary of World Broadcasts</publicationName><copyright>KANSAS ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE SERVICEKANSAS ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE SERVICE#THE#STATE#OF#KANSAS#</copyright><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"12\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>December 24, 1996, Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR102</classCode><className>CENTRAL AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR114</classCode><className>CARIBBEAN ISLANDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC394</classCode><className>CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GR118</classCode><className>LATIN AMERICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
