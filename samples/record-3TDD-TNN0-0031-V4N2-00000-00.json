Borzello</nitf:byline><nitf:dateline>KAMPALA, Nov 19</nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week's invasion of western Uganda by Zairean-backed rebels coincided with at least three other rebel attacks in different parts of Uganda, the official New Vision newspaper reported here Tuesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Quoting two Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels, who recently surrendered to the government, New Vision said that LRA leader Joseph Kony met last month at his base in southern Sudan with three other rebel groups -- the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), the Tabliq Moslems and the Uganda People's Army (UPA).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Tabliqs are now allied to the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU) under the umbrella of Allied Democratic Movement/Army (ADM/A), which invaded Uganda on November 13.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The meeting was aimed at coordinating the timing of the invasion of Kasese district of western Uganda, which has left more than 200 people dead since it started.</p><p>The LRA has been battling government troops in northern Uganda for the past 10 years in a campaign to overthrow President Yoweri Museveni's secular government and to replace it with one based on the Ten Commandments.</p><p>In September, 400 of its fighters entered the country from Sudan apparently to reinforce those already involved in major guerrilla warfare inside the country.</p><p>The WNBF, led by former dictator Idi Amin's foreign minister Juma Oris, also entered Uganda from Sudan through Zaire, as well as maintaining pressure on Ugandan forces inside the country.</p><p>But the UPA, led by former president Milton Obote's minister of state for defence Peter Otai and once active in eastern Uganda, had stopped operating several years ago.</p><p>Despite claims by the Ugandan government that the ADA threat was now over, the independent Crusader newspaper reported Tuesday that a group of ADA fighters secured the border trading centres of Mpondwe and Bwera and infiltrated Bushenyi district further south.</p><p>Ugandan troops regained Bwera on Saturday and retook the Mpondwe border post on Sunday, but fighting was said to be still going on in the area, with press here reporting fighting Monday at Kiburara, 28 kilometres (17 miles) from Kasese town, the regional capital.</p><p>The rebels were also reported to be in control of Kinyansi, seven kilometres (nearly four miles) from Bwera.</p><p>As a result of the fighting, the Monitor newspaper said, there were some 70,000 registered refugees in Kasese district, with an estimated 30,000 others believed to be staying with relatives.</p><p>Although the Ugandan government has persistently said that the rebel ADA was backed by Zairean armed forces, there have been no reports of Zaireans being taken prisoner in the ongoing fighting, nor have journalists, quoting witnesses, reported any sightings of Zairean soldiers inside Uganda.</p><p>But in a statement faxed to the Ugandan press on Monday, ADA's general secretary Sentamu Kayiira disclosed for the first time that the plot to invade Uganda was hatched outside the Ugandan capital Kampala, but denied that the movement had its bases in Zaire.</p><p>It also dissociated itself from the NALU rebel group, whose fighters the government and witnesses said to be among the invading force.</p><p>Kayiira said in his statement that ADA was fighting to remove the Ugandan president, whom he referred to as a \"Rwandese Tutsi,\" and claimed that the May 9 presidential election results in which Museveni scored three-quarters of the vote were rigged.</p><p>Meanwhile, another rebel group, the National Democratic Alliance led by Major Herbert Itongwa, has claimed responsibility for the September 13 attack on Seeta police post in central Uganda's Mukono district in which one police officer was killed.</p><p>However, two other rebel groups, the Uganda Federal Democratic Front and the Ninth October Movement, have since also claimed responsibility.</p><p>anb/lto/gd/gk</p><p>AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata
