closeted with his aides here Monday on the eve of the announcement of a transitional government to rule this vast and despoliated country after the flight of president Mobutu Sese Seko.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was no immediate word on when Kabila would travel to Kinshasa, but diplomats here said they expected him to wait a few days until his troops were absolutely sure they had secured the capital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kabila, who proclaimed himself president of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Saturday morning as his troops entered Kinshasa, promised then to set up a government of national salvation within 72 hours.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That self-imposed deadline expires around 0930 GMT Tuesday.  tuesday.</p><p>The new regime says the transitional government will be open to opposition politicians in Kinshasa, excluding those who supported Mobutu, but that parties will have no role at this stage.</p><p>South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who held talks with Kabila in this southern stronghold on Sunday, said afterwards that he was convinced the new government would be broad-based.</p><p>In the capital, the leader of the radical opposition, Etienne Tshisekedi, known as \"the Sphinx,\" was keeping a low profile Sunday, and not commenting on events, but his principal adviser, Gaston Mukendi, indicated that he would play a waiting game for the time being.</p><p>\"At the moment it is still a military situation,\" Mukendi told AFP. \"We must wait until things are secure and we will hope to make some contacts. â€¦ We hope that everyone will now begin to work together.\"</p><p>Roman Catholic Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo, who was named parliamentary speaker in the dying days of the Mobutu regime but did not accept the post, said: \"There are some ideas building but I can say nothing for the moment.\"</p><p>\"We must work as hard as possible for a consensus,\" he added.</p><p>Observers in Lubumbashi are expecting Kabila to name the nucleus of the government on Tuesday, leaving some posts to be filled later after fuller discussions with politicians who took no part in the seven-month civil war.</p><p>The government is expected to be formed on the French model, with a strong president but a cabinet presided over by a prime minister.</p><p>The new regime will also have to fill top civil service posts and name new ambassadors.</p><p>The pattern in the territories conquered during the war has been to leave most civil servants in place, giving everyone a chance to prove they can adapt to a regime that forbids corruption.</p><p>Some changes have been made, such as the replacement of the rector at the University of Lubumbashi after agitation by students.</p><p>The higher ranks of the civil service in Kinshasa are more critical, however, and the new regime is expected to make changes there.</p><p>Countries around the world were continuing Monday to announce their recognition of Kabila as the new head of state as calm returned to Kinshasa after his troops' virtually unopposed entry there at the weekend.</p><p>Mobutu was reported to be in Togo, and the leading figures of his government have all fled the country.</p><p>The country has at least 450 political parties, many of them tiny, and about the same number of tribes, none of them dominant.</p><p>Kabila has promised the convocation of an assembly within two months to draw up a new constitution.</p><p>That will be followed by elections expected in around two years, though his regime has given no timetable for them.</p><p>No census was taken during Mobutu's rapacious 32 years of rule, and estimates of the population of this country, around the size of western Europe, are largely guesswork.</p><p>The regime will have to issue voting cards before the elections, and also embark on voter education.</p><p>All real power under Mobutu was in the president's hands, with his 738-member \"transitional\" parliament spending most of its time arguing over trivialities.</p><p>hn/gd gd</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source
