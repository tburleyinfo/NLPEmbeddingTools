He has since been convalescing at his luxury cliff-top villa, where apart from several meetings with visiting officials, he has insulated himself from the chaos sundering his country.</p><p>He held talks with several regional leaders who visited the villa as well as UN special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Canadian diplomat Raymond Chretien, who urged him to return home to try to bring peace to the region.</p><p>Mobutu's supporters believe he may be able to lead a counter-offensive in the east to \"boot the enemy across the borders,\" as officials have put it.</p><p>On the political front, newspapers close to Mobutu's main rival in the past, Etienne Tshisekedi, are being much quieter than usual in denouncing the \"dictator\" and looking for a reconciliation between their leader and the head of state.</p><p>Tshisekedi's aides argue that the only \"legal\" way out of a political impasse is for the former premier to take back the helm and form a \"national unity government.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, government officials in Zaire were urging people onto the streets of Kinshasa to welcome the ailing leader home.</p><p>Police and security forces were in place along the 25 kilometre (15 mile) route leading from Kinshasa's Ndili airport to the Tshatshi barracks.</p><p>The authorities earlier requisitioned buses and trucks to marshall crowds for what the Salongo newspaper on Tuesday forecast would be an \"ecstatic\" welcome.</p><p>Salongo is close to the government, but other newspapers claimed the welcome would be a carefully stage-managed media event.</p><p>Even when in the country, public sightings of Mobutu in Zaire are rare. He made a brief visit to Kinshasa in January to commemorate the victims of the air disaster which killed 350 people when a plane crashed into a market near the airport.</p><p>bur/db/ccr</p><p>AFP</p><p>Crowds jostled to catch a glimpse of him, police and soldiers proudly saluted and banners proclaimed his glorious return.</p><p>For the man at the centre of the acclaim, upright in his open-top car as he acknowledged the thousands of people on the 60-kilometre (40-mile) route home, it could have been the good old days all over again.</p><p>But as President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire returned to his people after a four-month absence, his country lay economically crippled, his army bloodied and bruised and a chunk of eastern Zaire in rebel hands.</p><p>From early in the morning, loyal supporters began gathering at junctions, roundabouts and along the road from Kinshasa's airport to Mobutu's official residence at Tshatshi barracks, where his presidential guard is based.</p><p>Flags flew, banners praised his leadership and schools and markets closed down for the afternoon as the people of Kinshasa mobilised themselves.</p><p>Eager spectators vied for places on vehicles going to the airport, others jostled for key vantage points en route, and hundreds of schoolchildren were marshalled at a junction normally packed with opposition activists.</p><p>\"Today is the day of Zaire's liberation from the rebels who are illegally occupying the east of our country,\" one said.</p><p>Protected by men of the civil guard and the presidential guard, two elite units under Mobutu's direct control, the president took three hours to travel the 60 kilometres from the airport to Tshatshi.</p><p>He appeared weakened by his August prostate cancer operation and the four months he spent convalescing in Europe, but remained standing alongside his wife in the open-top car.</p><p>Wearing his traditional leopardskin hat, he never tired of acknowledging the cheers of the crowds.</p><p>At a crossroads just 500 metres (yards) from the residence, security forces assigned to protect the cortege joined in the welcome. \"We have waited so long and we can't help joining in with the crowds,\" an overwhelmed gendarme said.</p><p>For all the scenes of celebration, however, it was not clear exactly how many were genuinely pleased to see the president. In some quarteres, notably the poorer areaas of the sprawling capital, indifference reigned.</p><p>Despite official calls for a mass mobilisation to greet Mobudu, shops and markets there remained open and it was business as usual for the clubs.</p><p>Earlier Mobutu had gone walkabout immediately after his plane touched down, shaking hands with some of the thousands who had been marshalled to greet him at the airport.</p><p>Authorities had requisitioned buses and trucks to bring in crowds for what the pro-government Salongo newspaper forecast would be an \"ecstatic\" welcome.</p><p>Other newspapers claimed it would simply be a carefully stage-managed media event.</p><p>Even when he is in Zaire, public sightings of Mobutu are rare, although he made a brief visit to Kinshasa in January to commemorate the victims of an air disaster that killed 350 people, when a plane crashed into a market.</p><p>jg/km/jkb</p><p>AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP1996</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3TDD-TGR0-0031-V0J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1124\"/><timeReceived>17:19 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Agence France Presse</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1996 Agence France Presse</copyright><publicationDate month=\"12\" day=\"17\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>December 17, 1996</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>COTE D'AZUR HOLDING  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className> COTE D'AZUR HOLDING </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>COTE D'AZUR HOLDING  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className> COTE D'AZUR HOLDING </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>  COTE D'AZUR HOLDING  </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className> COTE D'AZUR HOLDING </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001456</classCode><className>REBELLIONS &amp;
