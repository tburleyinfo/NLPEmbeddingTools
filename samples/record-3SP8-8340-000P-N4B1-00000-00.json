Shops, offices and public transportation were shut down throughout the day as residents of this normally bustling city of 4.5 million heeded the opposition's call to stay at home.</p><p>The strike was organized by supporters of the recently dismissed Prime Minister, Etienne Tshisekedi. It was part of what has emerged as an undeclared race between him and the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, for control over Kinshasa and credit for bringing Mr. Mobutu down, Zairian political analysts and foreign diplomats said.</p><p>But as if to emphasize the ascendancy of his rebellion, Mr. Kabila flew today to the capital of Zaire's southern copper belt, Lubumbashi, the country's second-largest city, where his arrival drew large crowds of well-wishers.</p><p>The strike by Mr. Tshisekedi's followers in the capital was seen as a blunt challenge to Mr. Mobutu's authority and to his decrees last week setting up a new military-led Government and imposing a state of emergency. Before being removed last week, Mr. Tshisekedi was prevented by soldiers from entering his office after a violent crackdown on a rally of his supporters.</p><p>\"Today we have a dead city, dead villages, dead schools and a dead country,\" said Andre Kyushe, a supporter of Mr. Tshisekedi who manned a barricade in a Kinshasa suburb. \"What we are waiting for is a dead Mobutu, and we won't stop now until he is out of the way.\"</p><p>Flouting Government warnings against public protests, opposition leaders said they would step up civil disobedience over the next two days by closing schools and commandeering vehicles for raucous motorized protests. On Wednesday, they are planning a massive anti-Government demonstration.</p><p>\"This is the sixth year of our struggle against Mobutu, and there is no way we are going to back down just because a general gives an order,\" said Mukendi wa Mulumba, a senior official in Mr. Tshisekedi's party, the Union for Social Progress and Democracy. \"We fear a violent reaction and an explosion, but we are confident in our people.\"</p><p>Last week the rebel movement, which calls itself the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, gave Mr. Mobutu, 66, an ultimatum to begin talks on his resignation within 72 hours or face a resumption of the rebel army's one-sided war against what has been a completely ineffective national army.</p><p>The next day, Saturday, Mr. Mobutu called Mr. Kabila a \"gang leader,\" and said that he would only begin discussions with him if the rebel leader addressed him \"politely.\"</p><p>The rebel response was swift and menacing: an announcement that the President had run out of chances to talk and would now be forced out of power and into exile.</p><p>After watching the rebels capture half or more of Zaire's territory, including three of its four largest cities and almost all of its mineral resources, few people here doubt that the rebellion can make good on its threats.</p><p>But for now, foreign diplomats here dismiss rebel claims of being as near as 160 miles to Kinshasa and believe that the most advanced rebel troops in the central city of Kananga, about 500 miles to the east.</p><p>The next and last major city between the rebels and Kinshasa, analysts say, is Kikwit, which may take as long as two weeks for the rebels to reach.</p><p>With Mr. Mobutu's army in collapse, the rebels' biggest challenge has been the great distances between cities in a country one-third the size of the United States.</p><p>Throughout most of their seven-month war, rebel forces have moved without motorized vehicles, advancing by foot or in dugout canoes and typically covering anywhere from 20 and 60 miles a day, depending on the terrain.</p><p>\"The only military obstacle now between the rebels and Kinshasa is the state of the roads,\" said one regional military expert. \"And they are just about the worst in Africa.\"</p><p>For many here the most immediate question is whether fighting or widespread panic and looting can be avoided in the capital.</p><p>In most of his major conquests, Mr. Kabila has destabilized cities days or even weeks ahead of time by spreading rumors, planting tracts and using infiltrators.</p><p>Unpaid and untrained Government soldiers eventually grow so uneasy over the prospects of a confrontation that they flee even before the rebels arrive, often pillaging cities as they abandon them.</p><p>Kinshasa has a history of devastating army riots, and with the deeply corrupt political establishment here already on edge over the arrival of a score-settling revolutionary regime, many residents and diplomats fear that little more than a spark could set off a conflagration.</p><p>Diplomats here say they hope that Mr. Kabila realizes this danger.  Even as he and Mr. Tshisekedi size each other up and employ divergent tactics against the Government, diplomats said they would like to see the rebel leader build political bridges to Kinshasa and find ways to put the army here at ease before he arrives.</p><p>\"If he is intelligent, he comes in here with allies in place -- military and civilian,\" said one Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"The last thing you would want is to have 10,000 to 15,000 Government soldiers all disappearing with their weapons, and the old political class trying to organize them into resistance because they are bitter over a lack of power-sharing.\"</p><p>But so far Mr. Kabila has expressed no desire to include Zaire's opposition leaders in a transitional government. Several other recent moves by the rebel leader will also undoubtedly be seen as provocative by Mr. Mobutu's allies and those of Mr. Tshisekedi.</p><p>Two weeks ago, days before the rebellion had swept into Zaire's diamond-mining capital of Mbuji-Mayi, the head of the state diamond firm, Jonas Mukamba, took a major risk and announced that he would be willing to cooperate with Mr. Kabila.</p><p>Still, Mr. Mukamba was reportedly arrested and flown off to the eastern, rebel-held city of Goma, where he is believed to be under interrogation over the company's finances.</p><p>Today the Governor of Shaba Province, Kyungu wa Kumwanza, a popular local opposition politician, was removed by Mr. Kabila and replaced by a high-ranking rebel officer who is a cousin of the rebel leader.</p><p>Mr. Kyungu was ousted even after he had helped defuse tensions as the rebels approached Lubumbashi, spreading word that the rebels were welcome, preaching against pillaging and calling on Mr. Mobutu to resign.</p><p>\"This is not a very good sign,\" said one diplomat. \"People try to reach arrangements with Kabila and he sweeps them aside. What that leaves a lot of people wondering is if he isn't just going to be another Mobutu.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: A strike by opponents of Zaire's President, Mobutu Sese Seko, brought the capital, Kinshasa, to a virtual standstill yesterday.
