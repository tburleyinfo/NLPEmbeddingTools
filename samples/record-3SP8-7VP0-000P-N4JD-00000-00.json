FRENCH </nitf:byline><nitf:dateline>KINSHASA, Zaire, April 28</nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the last military defenses east of this capital city crumbling, a special White House envoy arrived here today carrying a message from President Clinton to the Zairian leader, Mobutu Sese Seko, reportedly urging him to step down to avoid further bloodshed for his country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The envoy, Bill Richardson, the United States delegate to the United Nations, is scheduled to meet with Mr. Mobutu early on Tuesday, apparently in an effort to persuade him to agree without delay to transitional arrangements that would end his reign after nearly 32 years in power.</p><p>The contents of Mr. Clinton's letter to Mr. Mobutu were being closely guarded. But Mr. Richardson, in a brief statement upon his arrival, said that he would be urging both the Zairian President, 66, who is gravely ill with prostate cancer, and Laurent Kabila, the rebel leader who controls most of Zaire and now threatens to capture Kinshasa, to quickly agree to the terms of a peaceful transition.</p><p>\"The United States strongly believes that there can be no military solution to the crisis, but rather a negotiated settlement leading to an inclusive transitional government and fair and free elections,\" Mr. Richardson said. He added that he was bearing a message for Mr. Kabila saying that the rights of refugees in rebel-controlled areas must be respected. There have been reports of atrocities against Rwandan Hutu refugees by Mr. Kabila's forces.</p><p>Mr. Richardson plans to fly from Kinshasa to the southern Zairian city of Lubumbashi to meet with Mr. Kabila on Tuesday, and will continue on to Angola, where the Government and Unita, a former rebel movement in that country that now holds seats in Parliament, are believed to have taken opposite sides in the Zairian conflict.</p><p>For several days now, Mr. Mobutu and Mr. Kabila have agreed on the principle of a meeting, but they have differed sharply both on an agenda and on a place to conduct their talks. Mr. Kabila, who now appears to be militarily unstoppable, has said that he will settle for nothing less than a full handover of power.</p><p>Even as Mr. Richardson was arriving today to try to bring about talks between the two leaders, news began spreading in Kinshasa of the fall of the city of Kikwit, a town 240 miles to the east of here that is the last major city between the rebel-held east and the capital. Rebels now hold about two-thirds of Zaire. There were also reports that a nearby provincial capital, Bandundu, was being looted tonight by Government forces.</p><p>\"Our men threw in the towel and have completely let us down,\" said one senior Zairian military officer who said that the Government had expected a hardy defense of Kikwit. \"Now the rebels are a four-hour train ride away from here and can arrive at any moment.\"</p><p>If the fall of Kikwit is confirmed, many fear a panic in Kinshasa, which relies heavily on neighboring areas to the east for its food supplies. There were devastating episodes of pillaging by the military during political crises here in 1991 and 1993, and residents in the capital are already bracing for a repeat of these troubles as Mr. Kabila's forces draw nearer.</p><p>Kinshasa's sensitivity toward events in Kikwit was dramatically demonstrated during an outbreak of the Ebola virus in that city two years ago, which immediately set off a panic in the capital.</p><p>In anticipation of widespread unrest here, the United States, France and Belgium have all stationed troops in the Congolese capital, Brazzaville, just across the broad Congo River from Kinshasa.</p><p>With Mr. Kabila's troops advancing with little difficulty and Mr. Mobutu, a man who has pledged that he would never be known as an ex-President, showing no signs of surrendering power, the prospects for Mr. Richardson's diplomacy seemed uncertain at best today.</p><p>As Mr. Kabila has drawn closer to his goal of toppling Mr. Mobutu, Washington has appeared to cool significantly toward the rebel leader.  Concern has arisen over statements he has made that suggest he does not intend to build a democratic government if he takes power in Zaire.</p><p>Mr. Kabila has stated, for example, that after taking power he would form a transitional government composed solely of members of his own Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, shutting out other opponents of Mr. Mobutu.</p><p>In addition, in the last week there have been widespread international statements of concern that Mr. Kabila's troops, who have been strongly supported by Rwanda's Tutsi-led Government, have committed atrocities against Rwandan Hutu refugees in Zaire. Mr. Richardson himself referred today to \"reports of massacres,\" saying \"this must end.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Bill Richardson, the United States delegate to the United Nations, arrived in Zaire yesterday, attempting to ease the transfer of power.
