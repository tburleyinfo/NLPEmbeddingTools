After his meeting with President Mobutu [Sese Seko] in southern France yesterday Etienne Tshisekedi spoke to Yves Rocle:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[Rocle - recording] Etienne Tshisekedi, hello.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[Tshisekedi] Hello.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[Q] You are the leader of the radical opposition in Zaire. Yesterday you went to Roquebrune Cap-Martin in southern France to meet Marshal Mobutu who is convalescing there. Why did you go to see Mobutu, given that you have long been at loggerheads with him and were sacked from the post of prime minister by him in 1993?</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>Source: Radio France Internationale, Paris, in French 0730 gmt 22 Nov 96</p></bodyText></section><p>[A] We are politicians first and foremost, and in politics personal feelings are set aside. We care first of all for the higher interest of our people. This is why I came to France, to pay a sympathy visit to President Mobutu, who is ill, and, secondly, through that visit to signify that which has been long awaited by our people as a whole and which we describe as national reconciliation.</p><p>[Q] Precisely on that point, Mr Tshisekedi, how do you define national reconciliation?</p><p>[A] But you have just said it yourself, because for some time President Mobutu used to say, I don't wish to cohabit with Mr Tshisekedi precisely because Mr Tshisekedi is - he said - a quarrelsome person. Now the law, the constitutional act, the constitution that regulates our country's affairs during the transition period makes it mandatory that the presidency be led - animated - as we call it - by President Mobutu, and that the government be animated by the person elected to that end at the Sovereign National Conference.</p><p>Now, with the reconciliation we have just had, President Mobutu will no longer oppose this and will therefore respect the constitutional act whereby I lead the government which we call a government of national unity - [interrupted by Rocle]</p><p>[Q] So as of this morning you regard yourself again as the prime minister of Zaire.</p><p>[A] Absolutely.</p><p>[Q] What will happen to the current prime minister, Kengo wa Dondo?</p><p>[A] He was the West's prime minister, not the Zairean people's prime minister.</p><p>[Q] You have the agreement of Marshal Mobutu, of the president of the Zairean republic, that you should become the prime minister of Zaire?</p><p>[A] But that is obvious, it follows from this national reconciliation .</p><p>[Q] So are you now going to form a government?</p><p>[A] Which we call a national unity government. So, on my return to Kinshasa we shall endeavour to engage in the necessary consultations with a view to receiving from President Mobutu's [political] family the names of agreed ministers so that on this occasion it may effectively be a national unity government. So there is nothing new in this, it was already envisaged after the end of the Sovereign National Conference.</p><p>[Q] To your knowledge, has Marshal Mobutu already informed Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo of his decision?</p><p>[A] I am not President Mobutu, so I cannot answer your question.</p><p>[Q] You are indeed not President Mobutu, but you met him, you reached an agreement with him. Must Mr Kengo wa Dondo indeed now go?</p><p>[A] My friend, it is up to you to draw the logical conclusions from what I have just told you.</p><p>[Q] Mr Tshisekedi, was it the situation in Kivu which motivated you to take that step last night in the company of President Mobutu?</p><p>[A] This situation you speak about in Kivu demands a solution, and in my opinion the solution can only come from a government which has the support of the people, because it is essentially an internal problem. Consequently, what I have done is the essential thing - that is, reconciliation between the two political families. As I have just told you, the rest will follow on: the government of [national] unity will be formed and will among other things tackle these problems in the east.</p><p>[Q] But how did you yourself feel about this defeat of the Zairean army in Kivu? Are you on the same wavelength as President Mobutu?</p><p>[A] It is for the president - we are in a pluralist society - to make his assessment. But you are speaking to Mr Tshisekedi wa Mulumba. My conviction is that this problem is essentially an internal Zairean one.</p><p>[Q] So you do not believe in the theory of Rwandan aggression?</p><p>[A] For the moment, I do not see what that is all about. Those are useless speculations. I am a leader; I prefer to tackle solving problems rather than making commentaries. I am not a man in the street.</p><p>[Q] Laurent Kabila, who has presented himself as the leader of these rebels in eastern Zaire, is also a long-standing opponent of Marshal Mobutu. He has proposed a common front for all opposition members; and nevertheless you have chosen not to heed that call?</p><p>[A] Kabila is a citizen of the country, and everyone, including Kabila, whether they were inside or outside Zaire, adhered to this project of the Sovereign National Conference. Consequently, when I tell you we have resolved this problem - Mr Kabila has adhered to this project - he is bound to do well out of it, because it is a problem which has been resolved by the Zairean family, the Zairean people.</p><p>[Q] Are you stretching out a hand to Laurent Kabila?</p><p>[A] You can already consider it that way, yes.</p><p>[Q] So do you think the Kivu problem can be resolved through negotiation?</p><p>[A] It has to be resolved through negotiation. I think we have spilt enough of our people's blood not to be able to allow ourselves the luxury of spilling the blood of one more single Zairean.</p><p>[Q] Etienne Tshisekedi, thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCSWB1996</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3S4Y-DTB0-0017-G51T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10962</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>BBC Summary of World Broadcasts</publicationName><copyright>KANSAS ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE SERVICEKANSAS ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE SERVICE#THE#STATE#OF#KANSAS#</copyright><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>November 23, 1996, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>RADIO FRANCE </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>RADIO FRANCE </className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>  RADIO FRANCE </className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001456</classCode><className>REBELLIONS &amp; INSURGENCIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX115</classCode><className>PARIS, FRANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GR213</classCode><className>MIDWEST USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC394</classCode><className>CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR118</classCode><className>LATIN AMERICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR114</classCode><className>CARIBBEAN ISLANDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
