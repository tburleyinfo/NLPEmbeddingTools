Friday as the \"Blue Helmets\" pull out of Rwanda despite continuing clashes between Tutsis and Hutus following the genocidal civil war in 1994.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The UN troops are withdrawing at the insistence of the Rwandan government, which regards their presence here as an affront to its dignity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The official deadline is midnight New York time on Friday -- 7:00 in the morning on Saturday here -- but the soldiers will parade Friday afternoon and lower the flag then, spokesman Ismael Diallo told AFP.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 1,230 soldiers and 146 military observers, plus the civilian staff, will have six weeks to leave -- until April 19.</p><p>They arrived on October 5, 1993 to oversee the establishment of a transitional government envisaged in an agreement signed by the then Hutu government and Tutsi opposition to end a three-year-long low-level civil war.</p><p>But on April 6, 1994, the plane carrying president Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down over Kigali and the country plunged into a bloobath, with Hutu extremists slaughtering more than 500,000 men, women and children before being defeated by a rebel army of the minority Tutsis.</p><p>The UN troops, 5,500-strong at their peak, came under strong criticism then for doing nothing to prevent the genocide, and also after the war, when troops of the new Tutsi-dominated army massacred Hutus in a displaced persons' camp as UN soldiers looked on.</p><p>But their departure, analysts say, is likely to increase the fears of the 1.7 million Hutus living in refugee camps in neighbouring countries.</p><p>Only a handful are returning, despite Kigali's assurances of the safety of the innocent.</p><p>General Paul Kagame, the strongman of Rwanda who led the Tutsi troops to victory and is now vice president, summed up the government's feelings about the Blue Helmets recently when he said: \"We are not a country under tutelage -- it is up to the government to undertake its responsibility to ensure the security of Rwandans.\"</p><p>But Rwanda remains a dangerous place, with constant clashes between the army and Hutu guerrillas, members of the defeated army and militias who slip across the border from Zaire.</p><p>The French newspaper Liberation reported last month that Tutsi soldiers had killed at least 100,000 Hutu civilians in cold blood since the war ended in July, 1994, a charge rejected by the government, although Kagame acknowledged last November in an interview with a UN human rights magazine that soldiers had committed unsanctioned excesses, including the killing of civilians, and that 600 soldiers were then in prison for assassinations, crimes of vengeance, and theft.</p><p>But he said then, in response to similar allegations of widespread killings by the military, that it would have been impossible to hide them in view of the number of Blue Helmets and UN human rights observers in the country.</p><p>The human rights observers -- now numbering 80 -- will stay on after the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) pulls out.</p><p>Spokesman Lee Woodyear said the government had asked that their number be increased to 300, but that the final number would depend on the operation's budget.</p><p>Other UN agencies such as the children's fund and the refugee agency will remain too, but the future of many UNAMIR operations remained clouded Thursday.</p><p>One is a radio station which broadcasts in Kiyarwanda, French and English and has won respect for its news bulletins, which do not hesitate to describe massacres.</p><p>\"I just don't know\" what will happen to it, Diallo acknowledged.</p><p>Staff at the radio station did not know either -- they were waiting for a UN Security Council debate on the end of the mission -- but were hoping that other UN agencies might take it over.</p><p>Diallo acknowledged that as a possibility, but pointed out it would have to change its name from Radio UNAMIR.</p><p>Another unknown factor is the fate of the full-scale UN hospital here, which Diallo said might be run by a combination of UN agencies.</p><p>The multi-million dollar question is what happens to UNAMIR's equipment -- the vehicles, transmission equipment, computers, office furniture and portable housing.</p><p>Some has already been shipped to UN peacekeeping operations in Liberia and Angola, Diallo said.</p><p>The government wants the rest -- for free -- but Diallo made it clear that priorities were first other UN peacekeeping missions, then other UN agencies in Rwanda, adding that some countries which had lent equipment wanted it back.</p><p>\"After that,\" he said, \"we shall see how much there is to donate -- or sell -- to the government.\"</p><p>hn/db</p><p>AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source
