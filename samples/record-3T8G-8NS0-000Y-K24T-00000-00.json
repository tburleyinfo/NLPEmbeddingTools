The White House urged him to make way for a democratic government, calling his three-decade dictatorship \"a creature of history.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Zairian president, who had declared a nationwide state of emergency on Tuesday in response to rebel advances, named an army general as the new prime minister. Gen. Likulia Bolongo had previously served Mobutu as defense minister and army chief of staff.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Likulia promised a crackdown on civil liberties, saying his primary goal was \"the restoration of public order.\"</p><p>The four-star general, dressed in his army uniform and surrounded by four other officers, did not elaborate on the crackdown at a news conference, but said measures would be taken against the news media if they published articles that \"affected the morale of the military.\"</p><p>Several foreign journalists, including an Associated Press photographer and APTV cameraman, were beaten and had their cameras stolen by soldiers during an anti-government demonstration Wednesday.</p><p>And in southeastern Zaire, rebels bent on ending Mobutu's nearly 32-year dictatorship reportedly captured Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city. They have already captured the eastern third of Zaire in their seven-month campaign.</p><p>The United States increased pressure on Mobutu to leave office, with White House spokesman Mike McCurry saying that U.S. officials want to see a transitional government, then elections.</p><p>\"That clearly reflects our view that Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history,\" McCurry said.</p><p>Last week, political parties allied against Mobutu named Etienne Tshisekedi as their choice for prime minister. Mobutu accepted his nomination in what was seen as a ploy to weaken the opposition by splitting it between Tshisekedi's supporters and those ready to join rebel leader Laurent Kabila.</p><p>Tshisekedi is revered in Zaire for the suffering he endured during his decades of opposition to Mobutu. Since his appointment, he had moved to undermine Mobutu by ordering parliament dissolved, annulling the constitution and offering Cabinet posts to the rebels.</p><p>The opposition lawmakers who had nominated him said he had gone too far, and they joined Mobutu supporters in calling for his ouster. On Wednesday, Tshisekedi tried to lead thousands of supporters to the prime minister's office to assume control.</p><p>Walking in the huge crowd with his hand raised in a victory salute, Tshisekedi confronted a row of soldiers backed by troops in armored personnel carriers. The showdown took place near a monument to peace and freedom erected in a traffic circle.</p><p>Mobutu's son, Capt. Mobutu Kongulu, appeared to be leading the soldiers. Hundreds of them fired tear gas at the marchers, with one canister landing near Tshisekedi. He was hustled into an army vehicle and driven away.</p><p>\"Mr. Tshisekedi was brought to his home for his own safety,\" Defense Ministry spokesman Leon Kalima said. \"He is not under house arrest.\"</p><p>Tshisekedi, later seen at him home conferring with aides, refused to speak to reporters.</p><p>Bruno Tshibala, one of the founders of Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress, said the protests would continue. \"We are living through the last acts of a desperate administration about to fall,\" he said.</p><p>The ouster of Tshisekedi and his replacement with a military general were further setbacks to Zaire's long-stalled democratic reforms.</p><p>A top aide to Tshisekedi said the ousted prime minister was pleased with the White House comment. \"The U.S. administration has finally come to see that the post-Mobutu era has arrived,\" Mtumbabo Clement said.</p><p>The rebels, meanwhile, said Tshisekedi's removal was insignificant to their cause.</p><p>\"He never had any power anyway,\" said Mawampanga Mwana Nanga, economic minister at rebel headquarters in the eastern city of Goma.</p><p>A resident of Lubumbashi, capital of the copper- and cobalt-rich Shaba region, said Wednesday that the rebels were exchanging gunfire with Zairian soldiers in the city. Thierry Mwengwe said he and other civilians in the southeastern city were in hiding.</p><p>A commander at the rebels' headquarters in Goma, who identified himself as Mufu, said the rebels control Lubumbashi.</p><p>The unrest throughout Zaire prompted the United Nations to begin reducing its staff in Kinshasa. U.N. spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt said 12 staff members would leave the capital within 48 hours.</p><p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed an order Wednesday for a possible evacuation of Russians in Zaire. U.S., French, British and Belgian troops are standing by in neighboring Congo for possible evacuations of their citizens.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-8NS0-000Y-K24T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>April 9, 1997, Wednesday, AM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
