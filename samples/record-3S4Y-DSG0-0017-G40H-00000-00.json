Two items were on the agenda. We will read you a complete report on this meeting. First of all, there was the situation in the east of the country, and secondly, the examination of three draft ministerial bills on the application of the law on press freedom.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>Source: Voix du Zaire, Kinshasa, in French 1800 gmt 23 Nov 96</p></bodyText></section><p>First of all, it is important to emphasize that the situation in the east of the country occupied the major part of the discussions. On this issue, the cabinet again reiterated its determination to reconquer the part of the territory that is in the hands of the enemy, and calls on the people to have confidence in their army and [words indistinct]. Still concerning the situation in the east of the country, the government examined the statement made recently by Mr Etienne Tshisekedi following his meeting with the head of state in France. It is worth recalling that in its 21st November communique the government informed the public opinion that information in its possession has demonstrated the implication of some Zairean and foreign nationals in events taking place in Nord- and Sud-Kivu. In fact, these elements of information establish that Zaire's aggressors have enjoyed the active complicity of some fellow countrymen during the attacks made against the authorities along the Rhodesia Plains, Bukavu and Uvira in Sud-Kivu, and the localities of Burnagana, Ilumba [phonetic], (?Sangunga) and Goma in Nord-Kivu.</p><p>Furthermore, the government made it known that as a reward for their complicity, the aggressors confided to some of these fellow countrymen the control of some Zairean towns and localities that fell to them. Today, the only flags flying in the above-named localities that have fallen to them, in particular Goma, Kanyaboyango [phonetic] and Uvira, are those of a certain political party. It is the flag of the UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress] party of Mr Etienne Tshisekedi.</p><p>The UDPS leader, who was the first to make a statement recognizing the Kigali government's seizure of power by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], has just made (?disturbing) statements which have shed light on the people [words indistinct] benefit by the elements of the complicity enjoyed by the Rwandan Patriotic Army [APR] elements in their aggression against our country. In fact, even though today the entire world [words indistinct] the United Nations, the OAU, the EU and even the countries which support Rwanda, admit that Rwandan and Burundian armies which are supported by Uganda attacked the Republic of Zaire, and that there were hundreds if not thousands of innocent civilians dead - as well men of the [Zairean] Armed Forces - as a result of this aggression, the UDPS chairman had the courage to say that there was no aggression against Zaire, but that it was just an internal affair involving [words indistinct] and some sons of the country with whom one must compose.</p><p>This statement by the leader, which smacks of treason and complicity with the enemy, has forced the government to file a case against the leaders of the UDPS at the civilian and military courts to establish the complicity of Etienne Tshisekedi's UDPS in the aggression carried out by Rwanda against Zaire, in order [words indistinct] and to appropriately punish all attempts to topple a law-abiding state and those guilty of disturbing the internal security of the state or to [words indistinct].</p><p>The government deplores the fact that while the country is at war, some of its own sons [words indistinct] can seize this opportunity to support the enemy with the sole aim of repositioning themselves politically. The government recalls that in conformity with Article 37 of the Transitional Constitution Act, every Zairean has the sacred right and duty to defend the nation and its territorial integrity and to prevent any individual or group of individuals from taking power by force. As we wait for ruling on the courts'course of action, the government leaves it to the people to judge the quality and the behaviour of this person who, after setting the fire, wants to serve as a fireman because of political gains, without considering the sufferings of the people of Zaire seriously affected by war and its effects.</p><p>Also, the government reminds the national and international opinions that the decision by the Supreme Court dated 21st August 1996 has put an end to the discussions on the legality of the election of Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo by the High Council of the Republic - Transitional Parliament, thus making the present transitional government the only legal government of the Republic of Zaire. The democratic law-abiding state which our people want to establish, in conformity with the wishes of the National Conference, demands that everyone at every level, be subjected to the law and the verdicts of tribunals and courts. It is curious to note that it is the very people who are aspiring to the highest post of responsibility of the state who are showing flagrantly their disrespect for the law, the legal bodies and public order.</p><p>Touching on the second topic on its agenda, the cabinet examined three draft bills presented by the minister of information and telecommunications. The first two bills addressed the application of Law No 96002 of 22nd June 1996, establishing the mode for the functioning of press freedom for newspapers, periodicals, on one hand, and audio-visual media enterprises on the other. The third draft bill deals with the fixing of administrative fares for the establishment of [words indistinct] prior possession [as received] of permits for the exploitation of radio and television stations, the exploitation of press agencies, the acquisition of permits for advertising agencies, and the authorization for photographic reportage. The session approved these three draft bills.</p><p>Before declaring the meeting closed, the prime minister informed the ministers of the visit that the Belgian secretary of state for cooperation carried out from 25th November to 2nd December. This visit follows the recent visit paid by the head of government to Belgium in August. The meeting, which began at 0900, ended at 1100 gmt.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCSWB1996</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3S4Y-DSG0-0017-G40H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10962</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1057\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>BBC Summary of World Broadcasts</publicationName><copyright>KANSAS ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE SERVICEKANSAS ADVANCE LEGISLATIVE SERVICE#THE#STATE#OF#KANSAS#</copyright><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>November 26, 1996, Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TDQ</classCode><className>US POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Governments</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX275</classCode><className>KIGALI, RWANDA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR213</classCode><className>MIDWEST USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC394</classCode><className>CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC554</classCode><className>RWANDA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC523</classCode><className>BURUNDI</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR118</classCode><className>LATIN AMERICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR114</classCode><className>CARIBBEAN ISLANDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC563</classCode><className>UGANDA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC396</classCode><className>ZIMBABWE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00099QF</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
