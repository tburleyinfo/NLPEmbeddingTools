But he made clear that rebels will march on the capital - the president's last stronghold - if the answer is no.</p><p>Two of Mobutu's once loyal foreign backers, Belgium and the United States, intensified pressure on him to resign.</p><p>His former allies were outraged when Mobutu cronies - including his son - blocked opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi from taking his seat as prime minister on Wednesday.</p><p>\"Mobutuism has no future, and now we have to see how to get to a transitional government,\" Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said in Brussels.</p><p>The White House called Thursday for rebel-government negotiations on \"interim arrangements for new constitutional authority in Zaire,\" McCurry said.</p><p>Mobutu, ailing and having lost more than a third of his country to the rebels, had succumbed last week to domestic and international pressure to name Tshisekedi as prime minister.</p><p>Tshisekedi promised to overhaul corruption and work toward elections, but the experiment in democracy didn't last long. After two days of pro-Tshisekedi rallies, Mobutu cracked down on activists, declared a state of emergency and appointed an old army buddy, Likulia Bolongo, prime minister.</p><p>A senior aide to Tshisekedi promised further resistance, and said the Tshisekedi administration - which considers itself Zaire's legitimate government - would seek to try Mobutu for high treason.</p><p>Joseph Yaone said Tshisekedi's path would continue to be non-violent. \"We don't have to prove ourselves against barbarians,\" he said.</p><p>Leaving little doubt about the new government's direction, Likulia wore his general's uniform and was saluted by his guards as he left his luxurious Kinshasa home for his first meeting with Mobutu as premier.</p><p>Likulia's convoy arrived at Mobutu's heavily guarded palace, overlooking the rapids of the Zaire River, just as a bugle call marked the noon hour.</p><p>The pomp and circumstance recalled Mobutu's good old days, immortalized on ministry building walls where yellowing photographs show the uniformed dictator receiving American and European dignitaries.</p><p>When Mobutu assumed power in 1965, the United States and Zaire's former colonial masters in Belgium saw the eager and capable young colonel as the key to stabilizing Zaire and thwarting Soviet expansion in the region.</p><p>But the friendship faded with the end of the Cold War and Mobutu's alleged tendency to keep mining revenues from Zaire's mineral-rich land for himself.</p><p>Mobutu clearly has been stung by the perceived abandonment.</p><p>\"I'm not propped up by certain embassies,\" he said during a rare public appearance last week. \"I don't depend on them.\"</p><p>One senior officer shouted at a reporter leaving Likulia's first press conference: \"The United States treats its friends like Kleenex!\"</p><p>The Belgian and U.S. ambassadors met with Likulia on Thursday.</p><p>\"I think that this country needs, very badly, change,\" U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson said after the meeting. \"What you need is responsible elected government.\"</p><p>Simpson said Mobutu did not necessarily have to step down to effect change. But the Belgians - with a large expatriate community and extensive business interests in Zaire - hope that change will come with Kabila.</p><p>\"Kabila is clear: He wants a transitional period and then democratic elections,\" said Derycke, the Belgian foreign minister.</p><p>Kabila on Thursday welcomed the U.S. distancing from Mobutu.</p><p>\"Everybody knows that this is the time for Mr. Mobutu to get out of power,\" Kabila said.</p><p>In the southeast, fighting continued Thursday on the outskirts of Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city. U.N. staff reported gunfire and explosions in the general direction of the Lubumbashi airport, spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt said in New York.</p><p>The rebels, meanwhile, said they were approaching Kinshasa and called on foreign nationals to evacuate the capital, according to a radio report monitored in nearby Gabon. Diplomats in Kinshasa said they had heard of the warning, but were not taking it seriously.</p><p>Some 1,300 Marines and other U.S. forces near Zaire were at \"a very high state of awareness and preparedness\" in the event an evacuation of Americans is ordered, Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday said in Washington.</p><p>Thabo Mbeki, the South African deputy president, indicated Thursday that South Africa may be willing to give Mobutu asylum.</p><p>\"I don't think we would respond negatively to that,\" he said in Washington. When asked if such a request had been made, he said no.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-8ND0-000Y-K1CT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>April 10, 1997, Thursday, AM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
