The discussion with AP reporters from around the world was moderated by Louis D. Boccardi, AP president and chief executive officer.</p><p>Earlier in the day, retiring chairman Frank Daniels Jr. bid farewell to member publishers and editors of the news cooperative, ending a five-year term that saw AP innovations in digital photography, advertising technology and online service.</p><p>Also at the meeting, election results from all-mail voting showed that John W. Madigan, chairman, president and chief executive officer of the Tribune Co., and Lissa Walls Vahldiek, vice president and chief operating officer of Southern Newspapers Inc., won seats on the AP's board of directors.</p><p>Five incumbents were re-elected: John J. Curley, chairman, president and CEO of Gannett Co., representing The News Journal of Wilmington, Del.; Donald E. Newhouse, president of The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J.; Mary Schurz, editor and publisher of The Advocate-Messenger of Danville, Ky.; George W. Wilson, president of the Concord (N.H.) Monitor; and, representing a city under 50,000 population, Gregg K. Jones, co-publisher of The Greeneville (Tenn.) Sun.</p><p>The AP meeting and luncheon were attended by executives representing AP's 1,544 daily newspapers. They were the opening events of the first full day of activities of the Newspaper Association of America's convention.</p><p>In a luncheon speech, White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles said he tried to help find work for fallen presidential friend Webster Hubbell because he was taught as a child to help people in trouble.</p><p>Bowles said he decided to try to help when U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor called him and told him of Hubbell's plight. Heeding his father's advice to lend a hand to friends in need, Bowles said he called three businessmen on Hubbell's behalf.</p><p>\"They were all old friends of mine,\" Bowles said, adding that Hubbell did not find a job as a result of those calls.</p><p>Daniels, who has been a member of the AP board of directors since 1983 and chairman since 1992, retired earlier this year as president and publisher of the News &amp; Observer of Raleigh, N.C.</p><p>\"I believe that AP is in the forefront of innovation - assisting our members without in any way conflicting with them,\" he said. \"Next year we're going to be celebrating our 150 years of existence, and in my judgment, The Associated Press continues to grow and improve each year.\"</p><p>Boccardi paid tribute to Daniels, saying, \"He is really a remarkable man and I have learned immensely from him - about business, about the news business, and about human nature.</p><p>\"He's cheered our successes and encouraged us to try again when we failed,\" Boccardi said.</p><p>Boccardi and Newhouse, the chairman-elect, pointed to the success of AP developments such as an online photo archive; AP StocksExpress, a paginated stock service for smaller newspapers; and AdSEND, a digital advertising delivery service.</p><p>Boccardi also offered a live demonstration of The WIRE, AP's online service for members, which made its debut in October 1996.</p><p>The panel discussion included Nairobi-based newswoman Karin Davies, AP vice president and special correspondent Walter R. Mears, Washington, D.C., special assignment editor John Solomon and White House reporter Sonya Ross.</p><p>Davies told the emotionally gripping story of being held last Halloween along with a photographer by government forces in Zaire and told to \"live your last moments. You're going to die.\"</p><p>They were freed hours later.</p><p>She prompted a round of laughter with her story about deciding not to tell her mother that she was covering war-torn Africa. The truth came out after her photographer was wounded and a photo of her cradling the bloody man was printed in her hometown paper, The Seattle Times.</p><p>A friend called her mother to say her daughter, at the time a London-based reporter, was in the paper.</p><p>\"And my mother said, 'Oh, at Wimbledon?\"' Davis explained.</p><p>Mears, who has traveled with seven presidents, said press access to the president has narrowed steadily over the years, thanks to an \"on-guard sense\" from politicians that comes from every word and action being recorded and dissected for public consumption.</p><p>Ross said first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is far more accessible on trips than her husband.</p><p>\"She comes back to the press quarters of the plane to commiserate over the day, to talk about some things that she may have on her mind, to see pictures that photographers took on the laptop,\" she said. \"He is on a larger plane; it's more difficult for him to come back.\"</p><p>Solomon noted that the White House has been unusually vigorous in turning over newsmaking documents related to the controversy over Democratic political fund-raising tactics. The strategy appears to be to release the documents before Republicans uncover them and to inundate Americans with so much information that they become less interested in the controversy, Solomon said.</p><p>In the board election, Madigan, representing the Chicago Tribune, succeeds Robert H. Hartmann, chairman and publisher of the Evansville (Ind.) Press, who did not seek re-election.</p><p>Vahldiek, representing The Baytown (Texas) Sun, will serve the last year of Daniels' term.</p><p>The other directors were elected to three-year terms.</p><p>Voting was based on membership bonds held by the newspapers that make up the news cooperative. Results:</p><p>- Wilson, 14,576 bond votes.</p><p>- Curley, 14,181.</p><p>- Newhouse, 13,288.</p><p>- Schurz, 12,843.</p><p>- Madigan, 12,116.</p><p>- Vahldiek, 6,747.</p><p>- Joe Hladky, president and publisher, The Gazette of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 5,712.</p><p>- W. Stacey Cowles, publisher, The Spokesman-Review of Spokane, Wash., 5,168.</p><p>- Peter A. Horvitz, president and CEO, Horvitz Newspapers, and publisher of the Journal American of Bellevue, Wash., 4,225.</p><p>- Marcia McQuern, CEO, president and publisher, The Press-Enterprise of Riverside, Calif., 4,063.</p><p>In the separate election for representation of a city of less than 50,000 population, Jones received 14,025 bond votes, and Uzal H. Martz Jr., president and publisher of the Pottsville (Pa.) Republican, received 4,255.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T7D-PS40-000Y-K3K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1088\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>April 29, 1997, Tuesday, PM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
