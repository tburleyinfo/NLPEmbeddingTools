Both aides spoke only on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Mobutu, 66, has a villa in France, which for decades helped to prop up his regime. He spent months there following prostate cancer treatment.</p><p>The diplomats, also speaking on condition of anonymity, agree that Mobutu plans to leave Wednesday to meet in Gabon with President Omar Bongo and possibly the presidents of Togo and Congo. All three countries have been strong Mobutu supporters.</p><p>Rebel leader Laurent Kabila, whose 70,000 troops have captured three-fourths of the central African nation in the past seven months, vowed Monday to storm the capital within days unless Mobutu immediately resigns.</p><p>However, a spokesman for South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Kabila claimed in a telephone conversation today with Mbeki that he has suspended his advance on Kinshasa for eight to 10 days to give Mobutu time to respond.</p><p>When pressed about Kabila's adamant denials earlier this week of talk of a cease-fire, and radio reports today that his troops have moved within 20 miles of Kinshasa, Mbeki spokesman Ricky Naidoo insisted: \"He said he has suspended his movement to Kinshasa.\" Naidoo's comments could not be confirmed.</p><p>U.S. envoy Bill Richardson, who met today with Mbeki in Cape Town, South Africa, said afterward that \"the peace process is very much alive. We are very encouraged.\" He was expected to fly to Paris on Wednesday.</p><p>For weeks, leaflets purportedly from the rebels have told Kinshasa residents that rebel forces were near and to prepare to welcome the new leadership. Kabila said Monday that the vanguard of his forces was 40 miles from Kinshasa's international airport and would be at the outskirts of the city of 6 million residents within days.</p><p>Rebel spokesman Raphael Ghenda, speaking from the rebel-held southeastern city of Lubumbashi today, said rebels already are in the capital. In the past, Kabila has placed political operatives in cities he has targeted to obtain intelligence and to prepare citizens for the rebels' arrival.</p><p>\"On our part, we would like to avoid bloodshed. Our main task is to protect the population against the extremists, against looting and against violence,\" Ghenda said. \"We will target only military installations in the city.\"</p><p>Mobutu and Kabila apparently made little progress toward ending the war during Sunday's talks aboard a South African naval ship docked in Pointe Noire, Congo. They agreed only to meet again within 10 days.</p><p>The French Foreign Ministry said today that U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun was at the presidential palace to brief officials about the talks between Mobutu and Kabila. \"We firmly hope … for an end to hostilities without delay,\" its statement said.</p><p>Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, delivered an urgent message to Kabila from President Clinton during their hourlong meeting Monday in Lubumbashi.</p><p>\"We stressed our longstanding view that for the benefit of the Zairian people … there should be a peaceful entry into the capital of Kinshasa - a soft landing which avoids violence and chaos,\" Richardson said.</p><p>The United States also wants an \"inclusive\" transitional government and fair and open elections, he said.</p><p>Mobutu agreed that a transitional authority should be established to organize elections. He said he would hand over power to an elected authority. Kabila, whose forces control all but Zaire's far north and west, demands Mobutu immediately transfer power to the rebel alliance.</p><p>The United States and other Western powers have troops stationed across the Zaire River in Congo and offshore to evacuate their nationals from Kinshasa, if needed. U.S. officials expressed growing concern Monday for the roughly 440 Americans in the city, worrying most about violence by Mobutu's forces.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-8B90-000Y-K073-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"713\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 6, 1997, Tuesday, PM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
