He also refused to board the ship by helicopter, invoking advice from his doctors that the vibrations could harm him.</p><p>After considering even using a crane to hoist Mr. Mobutu aboard, the ship was maneuvered so he could be driven up a cargo plank in an armored black Cadillac as he waved through dark windows to journalists.</p><p>It was not clear if Mr. Kabila planned to travel to the ship on Saturday, when diplomats hoped to reconvene. Reports from Luanda, the Angolan capital, where the rebel leader spent much of the day, said that Mr. Kabila was complaining he had not been officially invited to the meetings and that he was concerned about his safety.</p><p>But diplomats here said Mr. Kabila appeared to get cold feet out of fear that the discussions would require him to form a government not entirely of his choosing.</p><p>The United States has expressed its desire to see a \"broadly inclusive transitional government\" that could contain members of both Mr. Mobutu's political movement and Zaire's traditional opposition, which the rebel leader has resisted.</p><p>Tensions were high today in Kinshasa, the Zairian capital, a crowded city of five million, where many feared that word the talks had failed could lead to a panic by Government soldiers, who would then expect an imminent rebel assault.</p><p>Already the capital's leading hotels have been filling up with wealthy Zairians worried about a possible repeat of violent bouts of pillaging by Government soldiers in 1991 and 1993, which took numerous lives and left much of the city in ruins.</p><p>\"This is what these talks are all about, avoiding the burning of Kinshasa,\" said one Western diplomat. \"Kabila is coming one way or another. But hopefully it won't have to be with guns blazing.\"</p><p>The breakdown of talks even before they had begun left Mr. Mobutu, President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and President Clinton's special envoy, Bill Richardson, steaming off the Congolese port aboard the Outeniqua, the South African icebreaker chosen as a neutral meeting place.</p><p>In Washington, Administration officials expressed disappointment and annoyance with Mr. Kabila.  \"The U.S. Government is very disappointed, and Kabila's refusal to show is directly contradictory to all the assurances he gave Richardson,\" one official said. \"It just doesn't go over very well.\"</p><p>Many had wondered whether Mr. Mobutu's health would allow him to negotiate at all with Mr. Kabila, the rebel leader whose armies control over two-thirds of Zaire and are now advancing on the capital.</p><p>From their conception, the talks between Mr. Mobutu and Mr. Kabila, an idea worked upon for weeks by Mr. Mandela, and pushed strongly during Mr. Richardson's shuttle diplomacy of the last few days, have been plagued by strong disagreements over an agenda.</p><p>Even as Mr. Kabila was waiting for Mr. Mobutu to board the ship, before setting out to join him, his troops, heavily assisted by Angola, have been massing around Kinshasa poised to strike quickly if Mr. Mobutu refuses to resign.</p><p>Advanced elements of Mr. Kabila's army are now believed to be little more than 100 miles east of Kinshasa, and Western intelligence reports indicated that rebel units were massing to the southwest of the capital, near the Angolan border with Bas-Zaire province.</p><p>In addition, rebel units were said to be fast moving into position to attack the capital from Tshikapa to the southeast, also near the border with Angola.</p><p>As if to drive home the point that Mr. Mobutu's political end is at hand, the rebels announced today that they had taken the President's birthplace, the northern city of Lisala, without a fight from Government troops, who looted the town before fleeing.</p><p>Though widely believed to be nearing death, Mr. Mobutu has been fighting for a departure that would allow him to hand over power with dignity to an interim authority, rather than to Mr. Kabila directly.</p><p>Deepening the air of uncertainty, close associates of the Mobutu family have said that whether or not the President agrees on anything with Mr. Kabila, his health will not allow him to come back after the talks. The fortunes and leverage of the two sides were reflected today by their supporting casts. Mr. Kabila spent hours meeting in Luanda, Angola, with his two biggest backers, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and Vice President Paul Kagame of Rwanda.</p><p>Rwanda committed officers, equipment and troops at the earliest stages of Mr. Kabila's uprising, and Western diplomats say Angola has contributed large amounts of cash in recent weeks, as well as tanks and other heavy weapons, and airlift capacity for moving troops around the vast Zairian countryside.</p><p>Asked what the involvement of the outside countries was about, a member of Mr. Richardson's delegation said, \"Payback, payback, and in Angola's case, diamonds.\"</p><p>Mr. Mobutu has had a large hand in the civil wars of both Rwanda and Angola, and Zaire's support for Angola's rebel movement enabled its leader, Jonas Savimbi, to control most of the border between the two countries, and Angola's lucrative diamond trade.</p><p>Mr. Mobutu had hoped to bring at least two fellow African heads of state, Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and President Omar Bongo of Gabon, aboard the Outeniqua for moral and political support. But when Mr. Kabila got wind of this, he reportedly threatened to pull out of the discussions, and the plan to bring in other leaders was canceled.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire boarded his private jet in Kinshasa yesterday to fly to Pointe-Noire, Congo.
