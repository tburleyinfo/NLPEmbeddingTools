Close also attended Moise Tshombe and other political opponents of Mobutu in prison.</p><p>Close attended official banquets, meeting Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie and Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, among other African leaders.</p><p>He was at Mobutu's side on village visits, dispensing medicine, and listening to what the people said to their president.</p><p>He also witnessed U.S. ambassadors dressing down Mobutu, and the Zairian leader's humorous imitations of the ambassadors as soon as they departed.</p><p>As the country degenerated into chaos with the oil embargo of 1973 and declining copper and cobalt prices, exacerbated by Mobutu's disastrous nationalization, Close watched the president become a prisoner of his own machinations.</p><p>Mobutu and Close clashed as it became more and more difficult to get the money the doctor needed for the staff and patients of the hospital, which had been renamed for Mobutu's late mother, Mama Yemo.</p><p>When Close's wife Bettine became ill with hepatitis, he decided to leave in 1976. His eldest daughter, Tina, was living in Jackson, Wyoming, and the Closes bought a ranch above Big Piney to ''get off the world.''</p><p>Close was born to a well-to-do family in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1924. His lawyer father became the administrator of the American Hospital in Paris.</p><p>He attended Harvard, was a U.S. Army troop carrier pilot in World War II and then studied medicine at Columbia University in New York.</p><p>By the time he graduated in 1951, he and his wife had three young children. After completing his residency at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, he spent six years traveling the world for a missionary group called Moral Re-Armament.</p><p>The group sent Close to the Congo to do missionary work shortly before the country gained its independence from Belgium. Within a week, the army had mutinied, and he couldn't leave. He offered his services at the hospital, and soon became its only surgeon when a Belgian colleague left.</p><p>Mobutu awarded Close the country's top honor, the Order of the Leopard. He gave the doctor the use of an old C-45 transport plane that President Kennedy had donated to the country earlier.</p><p>Close never had a contract with Mobutu or the government. As director of the hospital, and chief doctor to the army, he was provided living quarters. He also saw private patients, and lived on that revenue until the early 1970s.</p><p>With growing family expenses they now had a third daughter, Jessie Close asked for a retainer and was given dlrs 40,000 a year.</p><p>Close doesn't regret having worked for Mobutu, but, ''I left when it became impossible to continue working.''</p><p>The final straw came, he says, ''when I fired a Zairian doctor for gross corruption and Mobutu insisted I take him back for political reasons. I refused.''</p><p>Close came to Wyoming and set up a small clinic in Big Piney.</p><p>In 1987, he began renewing his contacts in Zaire to research a book, and possibly a movie on the 1976 outbreak of the Ebola virus.  Daughter Glenn traveled with him to Zaire to visit the Yambuku Catholic Mission where the epidemic first hit.</p><p>When riots erupted in September 1991, Close used his contacts to develop a private newsletter on events in Zaire. He downloaded computer reports from news agencies in a basement office of his Sandhill home outside Big Piney.</p><p>Reporters in Zaire often found the Sandhill report more accurate than U.S. Embassy assessments.</p><p>Close also began lobbying the State Department and influential congressmen to try to persuade Mobutu to hand over power, and he spoke out against the mismanagement and excesses that had impoverished the population.</p><p>''The iron fists of President Mobutu's special troops continue to repress and terrorize the people,'' Close said in an appearance before the Senate subcommittee on African Affairs in 1992.</p><p>Mobutu has retained the presidency and control of the military, but has been forced to concede some power to a transitional government. That government invited Close to return to Zaire last year to work on projects aimed at restoring some basic medical services.</p><p>Close saw Mobutu for the first time in 18 years.</p><p>''We spent an hour together. Basically we talked about the situation of his people,'' Close said.</p><p>Close also remembers being ''moved to tears'' by the sight of hospital staff trudging three to four hours daily to work even though most of their patients had left because the hospital had nothing to offer them.</p><p>Glenn Close, asked to describe her father, said he is ''a complex, enthusiastic, committed and meticulous humanitarian.''</p><p>She once gave him a T-shirt that says: ''I'm not obsessive! I'm not obsessive! I'm not obsessive!''</p><p>In the past six years Close has been writing about his experiences. A historical novel, ''Ebola,'' was recently published and is on some best-seller lists. He is talking with publishers about republishing ''The Earth Is Not A Resting Place,'' a collection of stories about practicing medicine from New York to Zaire to Wyoming.</p><p>He is working on a new novel, and may be irresistibly drawn to writing about the Congo turmoil.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL1995</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3SJD-VFB0-0070-13SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"978\"/><timeReceived>22:12 Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Associated Press Worldstream</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1995 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"1995\"><dateText>August 31, 1995;
