Asked what his role would be in efforts to forge a national reconciliation, he said only: \"You will know within the next 48 hours.''</p><p>Mbeki said after the half-hour meeting that he had delievered a letter from South African President Nelson Mandela and that a UN peace plan for a truce followed by talks was at the heart of efforts to end the conflict. Mbeki aides said Mobutu had promised a reply within two days.</p><p>\"We are convinced that in the immediate future steps will be taken practically to move the peace process forward toward a resolution,'' Mbeki said.</p><p>Mobutu, 66 and wasting from prostate cancer, moved slowly and spoke only for a moment in his first appearance since returning from Europe, where he'd gone for treatment and convalescence.</p><p>In contrast to his return in December, when he was greeted by tens of thousands of well-wishers hoping he would end the war, Mobutu's strongmen ushered dignitaries and journalists out of the airport before he could be seen.</p><p>This spurred rumors that he was near death. When asked Sunday how his health was, he smiled and replied: \"As you see me.''</p><p>Kabila, whose popularity has been rising with each battlefield victory, called Saturday for a transitional government but said he would not work with anyone who had shared power with Mobutu.</p><p>Any transitional government should include his Alliance for Democratic Forces for the Liberation Congo-Zaire \"and only anti-Mobutists and anti-regime people who have never been in power and who never shared power,'' Kabila said.</p><p>Previously the rebels had said the would stop fighting only after Mobutu holds direct talks with Kabila.</p><p>Mobutu has so far refused. However, he announced Thursday from France that he intended to call for a national council that would bring all sides together - \"excluding no one'' - to reunite the nation.</p><p>The president also said recently that general elections are crucial to Zaire's development. Though Mobutu has reneged on promises of a transition to democracy for years, many observers believe he may finally step down, return to his hometown to prepare for his death.</p><p>Mobutu, 66, has ruled Zaire since seizing power in an army coup in 1965, but many ordinary Zairians, ground down by decades of poverty and hardship under his rule, are eager for a change and are openly rallying to Kabila.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-199703230041</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:475J-W770-01KD-R4K6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"541\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Canadian Press (CP)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Press News Limited, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"03\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>March 23, 1997 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001304</classCode><className>PEACE PROCESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001456</classCode><className>REBELLIONS &amp; INSURGENCIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DM6W</classCode><className>CEASEFIRES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001417</classCode><className>PROSTATE DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX001112</classCode><className>MEN'S HEALTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002115</classCode><className>PROSTATE CANCER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DD82</classCode><className>NELSON MANDELA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000A3A2</classCode><className>THABO MBEKI</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC394</classCode><className>CONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC336</classCode><className>SOUTH AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
