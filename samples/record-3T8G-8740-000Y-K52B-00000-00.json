His stance was described as ambiguous.</p><p>To promote democracy and a free-market economy, the Clinton administration has promised Kabila he could count on $ 10 million in American help in transforming the government once President Mobutu Sese Seko surrenders power.</p><p>This would involve direct financial aid, with European governments also expected to contribute a significant amount, said the officials, speaking about U.S. diplomacy in Zaire on condition of anonymity.</p><p>\"We spoke in terms of significant millions of dollars,\" an official told The Associated Press. \"And Kabila wants to remain in power for some time before holding elections.\"</p><p>Mobutu wants an interim leader installed, the official said, a demand contributing to Kabila's decision to postpone further talks with the Zairian president.</p><p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday she was certain Mobutu was looking for a way to yield power to a transitional government. The U.S. hope is that any transitional government, which is expected to include Mobutu and Kabila elements, would move quickly to prepare for elections in Zaire.</p><p>The resource-rich country has been ruled by Mobutu for 32 years, for most of that time with significant U.S. assistance as a strategic ally of the United States. In recent years, his authoritarian rule and the decline of communism have prompted Washington to keep its distance - and recently to try to encourage him to give way.</p><p>The question is whether Kabila would advance democracy in Zaire. His forces are on the outskirts of Kinshasa, the capital, and American diplomats are trying to avert bloodshed.</p><p>Albright told PBS-TV it was essential that Mobutu and Kabila get together and that Mobutu was \"looking for ways to have a transition.\"</p><p>She also said she could not \"get into the details.
