He threatened to expel foreign media who had suggested as much in their reports.</p><p>But Western diplomats and military observers said some high-ranking Zairian military officers close to Mobutu had already left the country or sent their families out, apparently fearing Mobutu's imminent fall. The latest to leave was Gen. Kpama Baramoto, former army chief of staff, according to officials speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Another general, Etienne Nzimbi Ngbale, who commands Mobutu's presidential guard, has sent his family out of Zaire, they said.</p><p>Mobutu Thursday met with his regional allies in Libreville, including Gabonese President Omar Bongo, Pascal Lissouba of Congo, Idriss Deby of Chad and Ange-Felix Patasse of Central African Republic.</p><p>About 190 kilometers (115 miles) east of the capital, meanwhile, reports were filtering in of fighting around the city of Kenge.  There was no independent confirmation of a claim Wednesday by aid agencies that 300 people may have been killed. The Red Cross said 10 of its local workers in Kenge were among the dead.</p><p>The rebels acknowledged Wednesday they were facing stiff resistance from loyalist troops in Kenge, which has an airport and could provide a good staging ground from which to fly troops into Kinshasa to secure the international airport.</p><p>The government insists it remains in control of the area and denies rebel allegations it has called on mercenaries from Angola's former rebel movement to assist Mobutu, who backed the guerrillas during Angola's 20-year civil war.</p><p>Both Kabila and Mobutu have been known to use foreign forces in their seven-month standoff -- Kabila receiving help from Uganda and Rwanda, and Mobutu using mercenaries from eastern Europe who were stationed in Kisangani before that eastern stronghold fell to Kabila.</p><p>Speculation of Angolan involvement was fueled by an incident Wednesday at Kinshasa's Ndjili airport in which government soldiers fired on a plane that was approaching and did not identify itself, military and airport sources said Thursday.</p><p>The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the unidentified plane landed without being hit and unloaded dozens of Portuguese-speaking passengers. Angolans, once ruled by Portugal, speak Portuguese.</p><p>South Africa, which hosted Mobutu and Kabila's first face-to-face meeting Sunday on a South African ship off the Congolese coast, was working on setting up another round of talks next Wednesday, despite speculation the rebels would be in control of Kinshasa by then.</p><p>Speculation that Mobutu would not return to Kinshasa had been ''largely exaggerated,'' said South African government spokesman Parks Mankahlana.</p><p>Diplomats in the capital, however, have expressed doubts the two men will meet again following their first encounter, which provided no breakthroughs toward a peaceful settlement. At this stage, they say, the best hope is to clear the way for a calm transfer of power in which Mobutu, 66 and ill with prostate cancer, resigns for health reasons and Kabila takes over as head of a transitional authority until elections can be held.</p><p>Kabila, they note, would be forced to call elections early or face a withholding of badly needed Western aid. In addition, he would be wise to stand for elections quickly while riding on the wave of popularity he currently enjoys for what appears to be the end of Mobutu's reign.</p><p>The rebel chief would also need to satisfy the demands of Zaire's people, who have made clear they won't be happy trading one dictator for another.</p><p>''People say Mr. Kabila is the savior, that he can change everything, but that's not true,'' said Honore Masudi, who fled fighting in the North Kivu region several months ago and was waiting for food being handed out to displaced Zairians at a church in the capital Thursday. ''We have to wake up. The only way for this country to develop is to hold elections.''</p><p>Unlike most people on the streets of Kinshasa, who relish the idea of Kabila marching into the capital and driving out Mobutu, most of those at the food distribution site said they had seen the effects of the war and didn't want to go through it again. Instead, they said Mobutu should return home and work out a deal with Kabila to stop his rebels and hold presidential elections.</p><p>''People have lost families, they've lost everything they own, and if the rebels force their way in, there will be shooting and civilians will die,'' said Sophie Supa, who had also fled North Kivu. ''Me, I don't support anyone to be president, but I'd rather have Mobutu stay on and see peaceful negotiations and elections than have Kabila fight him.''</p><p>(tas-bdb)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3RY4-5GY0-00BT-M06G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><timeReceived>14:56 Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>May 08, 1997;
