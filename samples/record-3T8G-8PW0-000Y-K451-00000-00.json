They don't recognize the sovereignty of our people,\" Kabila said at rebel headquarters in eastern Zaire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"For us it is a threat to our territorial integrity,\" said Kabila, whose forces have taken control of the eastern third of Zaire during their seven-month campaign to oust dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.</p><p>Kabila also said there should be no international intervention in Zaire.</p><p>About 1,200 U.S., Belgian, French and British soldiers forces have set up camp in Brazzaville, Congo, across the Zaire River from the Zairian capital of Kinshasa, in case Westerners have to be evacuated. The U.S. warship Nassau is also stationed off the coast of the central African nation, with about 1,000 Marines aboard.</p><p>While Kabila didn't say specifically that American troops should leave the region, he apparently fears there are more U.S. soldiers than would be needed to evacuate the 500 or so Americans who live in Zaire.</p><p>State Department officials in Washington refused to comment Sunday on Kabila's objections, but reiterated that the possible evacuation is the soldiers' sole purpose.</p><p>The rebels have kept up their advance through Zaire, although their representatives are meeting in South Africa with officials from Mobutu's government, trying to sort out a peaceful resolution to the crisis.</p><p>South African and Zairian officials were tight-lipped Sunday about progress in the first substantive peace negotiations between Zaire's warring factions.</p><p>No one involved would say where the talks were being held or even characterize the tone of the discussions. The two sides met informally Saturday because they were still waiting for some government representatives to fly in.</p><p>The rebels, who began the talks sounding like they were in no mood to compromise, appeared slightly more conciliatory on Sunday.</p><p>Despite earlier threats to withdraw from the talks if they did not begin on schedule Saturday, the rebel's representative in South Africa, Richard Wenu, told The Associated Press: \"We are prepared to wait however long it takes for a compromise.\"</p><p>Rebel forces are reported nearing Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city and the capital of the mineral-rich Shaba region. Mining industry sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that a vanguard group of rebels had reached the city, though it was unclear whether there was any fighting.</p><p>Kabila confirmed Sunday that the rebels had taken Mbuji-Mayi, the country's diamond-mining center, 435 miles northwest of Lubumbashi, encountering some opposition from Mobutu's forces.</p><p>The diamonds, and Shaba's copper and cobalt, have been a money-making machine for Mobutu's 31-year regime. Now, they will be revenue for the alliance.</p><p>Kabila said officials of the South-African-based Anglo American Corporation - the firm that owns the diamond mines - were in Goma on Saturday to renegotiate contracts.</p><p>Speaking Sunday of his plans for the future of Zaire, Kabila said he envisions a transitional government, a political reorganization, then elections within a year.</p><p>Last month, Kabila said only his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire would be allowed to function as a political party.</p><p>But on Sunday, he said other parties would be allowed to return to the political arena, possibly including Mobutu's Popular Revolutionary Movement party.</p><p>He insisted once again that the rebels would not share power with \"Mobutists.\"</p><p>\"The aim of the negotiations is for Mobutu to relinquish power. Power-sharing is not an issue.\"</p><p>The rebels, who control the important river city of Kisangani in central Zaire, agreed Saturday to allow international aid agencies to airlift Rwandan Hutu refugees from camps south of the city.</p><p>Relief agencies say about 120 of the estimated 100,000 refugees there are dying each day from malnutrition, disease and exhaustion.</p><p>The airlift probably will begin by the end of this week, the U.N. refugee agency said Sunday.</p><p>It will take that long to organize the highly-complex transportation and select the refugees most in need of moving but still able to survive the trip, said Pam O'Toole, chief spokeswoman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva.</p><p>Before reaching the two areas south of Kisangani where they are now concentrated, the refugees had traveled through the rain forests of eastern Zaire for more than five months.</p><p>They were driven into the interior by militant Hutus running from the Zairian rebels they were fighting. Among them, the rebels say, are some of the hard-core Hutus responsible for the massacre.</p><p>The Hutu refugees left their homeland in 1994 to escape possible retribution for the slaughter of a half-million minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T8G-8PW0-000Y-K451-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Associated Press  All Rights Reserved  Associated Press</copyright><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>April 6, 1997, Sunday, AM cycle</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
