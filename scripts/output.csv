./samples/,"With Zaire's cancer-stricken president in seclusion, speculation deepened over his health and ability to run the country. ''He can't even stand on his own,''  one opposition newspaper headline said Saturday of President Mobutu Sese Seko, who is back from Europe but unwilling or unable to meet the public or the press. ''Where's the Mystery Man?,''  another newspaper asked. On the streets of Kinshasa, the Zairian capital, people were abuzz over Mobutu's whereabouts, debating why he had himself whisked away after Friday's low-key homecoming. Supporters of rebel leader Laurent Kabila rallied in Kisangani, Zaire's third-largest city, and vehemently opposed talk of a cease-fire, while the United States and other countries sent troops to west Africa in case it becomes necessary to evacuate Americans. In Kinshasa, Nestor Mpolo, who is unemployed, said he didn't care if Mobutu 66 and suffering from prostate cancer was dead or alive. In his 31-year dictatorship, Mobutu has become one of the world's richest men and his country one of the poorest. ''Look at me. I'm older than 40 and have done nothing with my life because of him,''  Mpolo said. ''They say that he wants to die here but he's already dead.''  Yet others were praying for Mobutu's quick recovery so he could put his house in order. In his absence, Zaire has slid into insurgency, and rebels now hold a third of the Central African country. In a show of support for the president, young army recruits sporting freshly shaven heads paraded about Kinshasa on Saturday singing and shouting. Mobutu has spent much of the past seven months abroad, getting treatment for his cancer. Before his return Friday, he was in a Monaco hospital, reportedly with internal bleeding linked to previous surgery. Rebels took the strategic city of Kisangani last weekend. On Saturday, thousands cheered Kabila there when he vowed to keep fighting until Mobutu is toppled. ''Do you want a cease-fire?''  Kabila asked. The 5,000 Zairians booed, hissed and shouted, ''No!''  ''Advance, advance,''  they said. ''Freedom! Freedom!''  Kabila promised, ''This movement will continue until Gbadolite, until Kinshasa.''  Mobutu's jungle palace is in Gbadolite, near the Congo border. The rebels have captured a third of Zaire in six months and continue to make steady gains. Kabila said his troops in southern Zaire are now just 125 miles (200 kilometers) from Lumbumbashi, the country's second-largest city, and moving toward the diamond-trading city of Mbuji-Mayi. At the rally, Kabila also announced the suspension of political parties until the war ends. He said a transitional government will be formed exclusively by his rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire. ''We are in the process of liberation. If we accept political parties, they will tell lies to stop the advance of the Alliance,''  Kabila said. No one complained at least not openly about the ruling. ''We're all part of the Alliance now,''  said Eric Joseph Lunganga, vice president of the Democratic Union for Social Progress, or UDPS, the main opposition party led by Etienne Tshisekedi. The rebels have said they will stop fighting only after Mobutu holds direct talks with Kabila. Mobutu so far has refused. Kabila invited U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun to the rally. Sahnoun is trying to persuade the warring factions to lay down their arms before the whole region ignites. Concerned about security in the capital, the Clinton administration is sending U.S. troops to western Africa in case it becomes necessary to evacuate the 500 or so Americans in Zaire. France and Belgium have taken similar steps.","""1997-03-22T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-53J0-00BT-M4XW-00000-00"""
./samples/,"South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki returned here early Monday ""satisfied"" with a meeting he held in Lubumbashi late Sunday with self-proclaimed Zairean president Laurent Kabila, a foreign affairs offical said. ""Mr. Mbeki is satisfied with the meeeting,"" the official told AFP. ""He was informed by Kabila of his progress regarding the formation of a transitional authority."" Kabila, after the capture of Kinshasa by his forces and the flight of president Mobutu Sese Seko on Saturday, proclaimed himself head of state, renaming Zaire the Democratic Republic of the Congo. congo. He also announced that a government of national salvation would be formed by Tuesday, and an assembly to draft a new constitution would be convened within two months. Mbeki, who was the first foreign government representative to hold talks with Kabila after he took effective control of the country, announced after the talks that South Africa would recognise his government. He said he was convinced the transitional government ""will be broad-based and that it will provide the necessary stability to address the fundamental challenges of change."" South Africa's recognition opened the way to acknowledgement of the Zaire's new regime by a number of other governments, including Iran, Japan and Burundi. ""We are going to monitor the transitional process,"" the South African foreign ministry official said Monday. Mbeki, who was accompanied to Lubumbashi, in southern Zaire, by Defence Minister Joe Modise and Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, arrived at Waterkloof military airbase near here early Monday, where he briefed President Nelson Mandela on his talks with Kabila. Mandela, whose efforts at mediating a peaceful transfer of power in Zaire won praise from US President Bill Clinton, was at the air base preparing to leave for a three-day state visit to neighbouring Zimbabwe. bmk/br/ss The Central Selling Organisation (CSO), the selling arm of South African diamond giant De Beers, has reopened its diamond buying office in Zaire, De Beers said on Monday. ""We were asked about two weeks ago by the alliance to open the office in Mbuji-Mayi,"" De Beers senior communications officer Judith Annakie told AFP. The move signals an apparent change of heart by Zaire's self-proclaimed president Laurent Kabila and his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, who on Sunday took control of the central African country when they marched unhindered into the capital Kinshasa as President Mobutu Sese Seko and his forces fled or surrendered. A month ago, Kabila's shadow finance minister Mwana Nanga Mawampanga said he was not happy with De Beers' monopoly in the Zaire diamond industry and that he planned to renegotiate contracts with international mining companies. Annakie said that since reopening its office, the CSO had bought two shipments of gems by open tender from the Bakwanga Minerals (MIBA) mine at Mbuji-Mayi. ""There were a number of players but obviously we offered a better price,"" she said. The open tender method of marketing marks a change in policy for MIBA; in the past, De Beers had a renewable contract under which the mine's entire production--around 6.5 million carats--was sold to the CSO. While De Beers does not mine diamonds in Zaire, the CSO has in the past marketed one third of the central African country's annual production of around 22 million carats of mainly low value, low quality gemstones. Other CSO offices in Kisangani, Kananga and Kehemba had not yet been reopened, Annakie said. ""The situation is very fluid,"" she added. ""We continue to talk to the alliance."" De Beers spokesman Tom Tweedy, meanwhile, said he was ""relieved the situation in Zaire has come to a peaceful end."" ""We very much want to be a part of the country's future and are anxious to establish formal co-operation as we had before,"" Tweedy told the SAPA news agency. ""The nature of Zairean production makes us confident that the logic of the world diamond marketing situation will prevail."" Zaire's total official diamond production is estimated at around 450 million US dollars a year, or about six percent of world diamond output by value. Some alluvial diamonds are marketed by the CSO, others by independent dealers. MIBA is 80-percent owned by the Zaire government, with Sibeka of Belgium owning the remaining 20 percent. De Beers holds 20 percent of Sibeka and so has a minor indirect stake in the mine. De Beers has been prospecting near Mbuji-Mayi for the last two months, but operations are now on hold. br/hd n n","""1997-05-19T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-34R0-0025-F47P-00000-00"""
./samples/,"U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday that problems in the Angolan peace process might again postpone plans to form a power-sharing government. The installation of a government comprising former combatants in Angola's two-decade civil war already has been postponed three times. The ceremony now is scheduled for Monday in Luanda, the Angolan capital. But Annan's acknowledgement of ''a hitch''  in working out final details indicated another postponement was likely. ''I hope that we will be able to encourage the protagonists to put their differences behind them,''  Annan told journalists on his arrival in Cape Town for an African trip that will include stops in Namibia, Angola and Togo. ''I think the people of Angola deserve it. They are tired of war, and their leaders have to have the courage to give them peace and stability.''  At issue is the position and title for Jonas Savimbi, who led the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola rebels in the war. The Angola government and UNITA signed a peace treaty in Lusaka, Zambia, in 1994 that called for demobilizing fighters under security provided by U.N. peacekeeping troops, forming a joint army and setting up a unity government headed by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Most steps in the peace plan have been completed, though suspicions remain that Savimbi held back some of his crack fighters and best weapons from the demobilization process. Annan, a Ghanaian, was starting his first African trip since assuming office in January. His three-day visit to Cape Town and Johannesburg will include meetings with President Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu, chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, who met Annan at the airport Wednesday, said Mandela's talks Thursday with Annan would focus on South African peace initiatives in Zaire. Mandela tried to set up peace talks last month between the Zairian government and rebel leader Laurent Kabila, but the effort proved fruitless. Kabila's fighters have taken over a large part of eastern Zaire including Kisangani, the nation's third largest city. Kabila's followers aim to topple Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko, whose nearly 32-year dictatorship has left mineral-rich Zaire among the world's poorest countries. Annan, who plans to attend an African heads of state meeting on the Zaire conflict in Lome, Togo, next week, said he applauded Mandela's efforts to help resolve African crises. ''Africa cannot develop economically and socially unless we can resolve some of these political conflicts,''  said Annan, the first U.N. secretary-general from sub-Saharan Africa. He was optimistic about the continent's future prospects. ''When we look at the way you (South Africa) resolved your problems, it reminds me of the great African capacity for forgiveness and reconciliation,''  he said. Asked to comment on Israel's decision to defy worldwide opposition and begin a construction project in disputed east Jerusalem, Annan said: ''I am on the record as saying both parties should avoid any initiative that would impede the peace process.''

./samples/,"SOUTH AFRICA says it has arranged a summit between President Mobutu Sese Seko and the increasingly triumphant Zairean rebels in an attempt to establish a transitional government before a battle for control of the capital, Kinshasa. President Nelson Mandela said he had issued a formal invitation to Mr Mobutu to attend talks after meeting the Zairean rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, on Wednesday. Mr Mobutu's information minister, Kin-Kiey Mulumba, sees no obstacles to a first meeting once a venue and time are agreed. ""Things are getting clearer. Plans are afoot for a meeting between the head of state and the rebel leader. This meeting is imminent,"" he said. If Mr Mobutu does attend face-to-face talks it will be a big climbdown from his previous refusal to meet the rebels, and Mr Kabila appears not to have retreated from his insistence that negotiations must focus on Mr Mobutu's abdication. After meeting Mr Kabila, Mr Mandela expressed confidence that he favoured a peaceful resolution to the war, which has carried his Rwandan-backed Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo -Zaire across more than half the country in six months. ""He doesn't want a military solution. He has made this clear over and over again. He wants a solution which will receive the support of President Mobutu and he has also made it clear that he has no intention of doing anything which will humiliate President Mobutu,"" Mr Mandela said. Yet Mr Kabila has gone along with the South African initiative as much for appearances as from any belief that it will succeed. He first visited South Africa in February under pressure from his allies - particularly Washington - not to appear committed only to war. He could also ill afford to offend South Africa's revered statesman since the country will be a crucial ally in helping to rebuild Zaire. He went again more willingly after Mr Mandela addressed him as ""General Kabila"". The title conferred a degree of international recognition, to the consternation of the Mobutu regime. This time Mr Mandela referred to him as ""President Kabila"" in the same sentence in which he talked about President Mobutu, effectively offering them equal status. Despite the assurances Mr Mandela says he has received, it is evident that Mr Kabila favours a military solution. ""There will be no ceasefire until Mobutu relinquishes power,"" he said. ""The people do not want a ceasefire, they want an end to this corrupt regime."" Yet a negotiated transition might now suit the rebels, who control every key city except Kinshasa. The prospect of a battle for the capital of 7 million people is daunting. The last of Mr Mobutu's army will have its back to the Congo river and the alliance will require a big force to prevent Kinshasa descending into anarchy. Mr Kabila's finance minister last night accused Mr Mobutu of having ordered his secret police and elite units to kill all expatriates in Kinshasa to trigger foreign intervention. The massacre, which would be blamed on the rebels, could start ""at any minute"", Mwana Nanga Mawanpanga told reporters in Lubumbashi.","""1997-04-18T00:00:00Z""","""3TDG-VTK0-006X-B2FG-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Rebels in eastern Zaire called Sunday on the public in the rest of the country to support them and said they would not cease fire unless President Mobutu Sese Seko hands power to a transitional government. Laurent Kabila, leader of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), said the advance on the west would continue, the rebel radio station said Sunday, a day after the (ADFL) captured Zaire's third-largest city, Kisangani. He said the population had nothing to fear from ADFL guerrillas and should support the drive to oust Mobutu, who is staying at his luxury villa in the south of France. On Saturday, rebel forces burst through army lines around Kisangani and seized the nearby airbase without meeting serious resistance. Rebel units were advancing Sunday southwest towards the centre of Zaire's main mining region, Shaba. Kabila said in his statement after the fall of Kisangani that he agreed in principle to a five-point peace plan drafted by the United Nations and envisaging a ceasefire and negotiations on a political solution to the conflict. However the ADFL would not agree to any truce until the government in Kinshasa agreed in direct talks to resign and convey its powers to a transitional government. If Mobutu continued to procrastinate over serious negotiations, the armed struggle would continue unrelentingly. ""We will liberate the entire country. That is our aim,"" said Kabila. The ADFL leader met Saturday in the rebel stronghold of Goma with the United Nations' and Organization of African Unity's special envoy for Zaire, Mohamed Sahnoun.

./samples/,"Burundi coup leader Pierre Buyoya left Bujumbura Tuesday to confer with President Yoweri Museveni in Uganda and then go on to a Wednesday summit of regional leaders in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, state radio reported. The radio said he would explain the reasons behind his bloodless coup last Thursday and seek the regional leaders' support, but his welcome was uncertain. The regional leaders and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) did not invite him to the summit, and they--along with the rest of the world--still recognise ousted president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya as head of state. Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, was still holed up Tuesday in the residence of the US ambassador in Bujumbura. He sought refuge there on Tuesday last week--two days before the coup--after enraged Tutsis threw stones at him during a funeral for some 330 victims of a massacre by Hutu guerrillas. The guerrillas have been fighting troops of the Tutsi-dominated army since October 1993, when Tutsi soldiers assassinated Melchior Ndadaye, Burundi's first Hutu president. Most of the victims in what has now become a civil war are villagers, with both sides committing massacres. The Hutus make up 85 percent of Burundi's population of 5.5 million, but they are mostly peasant farmers, whereas the Tutsis, who make up only 14 percent of the population, control the power and the armed forces. Buyoya, a Tutsi, said Monday that he would announce a transitional government of national unity on Tuesday or Wednesday, but observers said that could be delayed by his attendance at the one-day summit. The OAU and most of the governments in the region condemned the coup with vigour, but condemnation in western capitals and at the United Nations was muted, in large part because of Buyoya's track record in restoring democracy to Burundi. An army officer, he seized power in 1987, but called elections in 1993 which he contested but lost to Ndadaye. Museveni is considered the ""godfather"" of the Tutsis in Rwanda who won that neighbouring country's three-month civil war in 1994 after Hutu extremists had slaughted more than 500,000 men, women and children. Many of the Rwandan Tutsis, living in exile in Uganda after earlier ethnic clashes, had served as guerrillas with Museveni and in his army after he seized power in Uganda in 1986. The ethnic mix in Rwanda and Burundi is virtually identical. Museveni nevertheless condemned Buyoya's coup strongly, and joined Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa in calling for Wednesday's regional summit. A regional summit in Arusha on June 25 decided to send a peacekeeping force to Burundi, requested by Ntibantunganya and his Tutsi prime minister, Antoine Nduwayo, who acknowledged that they could not contain the violence. But they were denounced as traitors on their return to Bujumbura, and extremists warned that the arrival of foreign soldiers would spark full-scale civil war. Buyoya said his government would be composed essentially of civilians from both tribes, but all Hutu politicians have rejected his overtures and called for his overthrow. A number of ousted ministers are in hiding in the French, Belgian, German and other embassies. Jean Minani, president of the Hutu-dominated Front for Democracy in Burundi, Ntibantunganya's party, said he was prepared to fight the new regime ""with all means."" He was on his way to Arusha Tuesday for talks with the leaders attending the summit, from Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Zaire, Ethiopia and the OAU. Reports Monday meanwhile said the death toll from two recent attacks by Hutu guerrillas and a subsequent army sweep in central Burundi could be as high as 200. ""We do not expect to be able to halt the violence immediately,"" Buyoya told a British television channel. ""But we shall do everything we can to reduce and then end it."" cpy/hn/js AFP Burundi's new leader Pierre Buyoya met with ousted president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya on Sunday, four days after a military-backed coup, the US embassy said Tuesday. Buyoya, a major in the minority Tutsi-dominated army seized power again Thursday, overthrowing Ntibantunganya, a Hutu who became president under a power-sharing accord drawn up in September 1994. Ntibantunganya took refuge in the residence of the US ambassador to Burundi two days before the coup, but has not resigned and is still recognized as president.

./samples/,"The governments and organizations constituting the international ''system''  or ''community''  have had little luck with Rwanda, truly a hard case. Undaunted, perhaps even the more determined, former President Jimmy Carter, a one-man global emergency service, has picked it up. If he fails, he will have exerted himself where most others flagged. If he succeeds, he will save countless lives and point Rwanda and its twin in ethnic stress, Burundi, toward survival. Rwanda is hard because leading elements of the 2 million refugees from last year's ethnic wars perpetrated the genocide. Their goal is not to lead their people home and set up an African Switzerland but, using the refugees as political and military cover, to knock off the regime that stopped their game. This is what prompted, and complicates, Mr. Carter's latest effort to jump-start repatriation of refugees. Mr. Carter brought together, in Cairo, Rwanda, Burundi and neighboring states straining impatiently under an immense refugee burden - Zaire, Uganda and Tanzania. The Cairo meeting being a gathering of governments, the refugees were absent. But the conference did produce fresh assurances - not the first - aimed at instituting a safe and orderly return of refugees and at sparing the Rwanda and Burundi governments attack by refugee-based tribal rivals. Rwanda has further been promised that a newly established international tribunal will prosecute those among the refugees accused of war crimes. In the difficult business of refugee repatriation, enforcement is always crucial. In this case it is doubly hard. There is not yet a working ''national unity''  government that might contain and reassure the refugees. There is only a slight and symbolic international presence on the ground. A few thousand United Nations peacekeepers are in Rwanda; their mandate is about to run out. Cairo offered support for extension. That is the least that others might do. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadaka Ogata, is following up with another early run at Rwandan repatriation. Her efforts, like Mr. Carter's, are welcome. A new report by her agency points out, however, that there is an alternative to post-spill crisis response: ''What might have happened in Rwanda if the estimated dollars 2 billion spent on refugee relief during the first two weeks of the emergency (and more since) had been devoted to keeping the peace, protecting human rights and promoting development in the period which preceded the exodus?''

./samples/,"[2] Excerpts from recorded news conference by Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko with Zairean and international reporters, from the ""One Hour To Convince"" programme hosted by Mohamed Issoufou Saliou, in Gbadolite, date not given; broadcast by Gabonese Africa No 1 radio on 2nd September; subheadings added editorially...Mobutu First of all, I have an introductory speech. Can I begin? Saliou You may begin, Mr President. Mobutu Ladies and gentlemen: Exactly one month ago, I was approached by Africa No 1 radio station for a news conference with the international press. I readily accepted this proposal. That is the reason for your presence here in Gbadolite. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome you in our midst... Belgium ""harming the interests of the Zairean people"" Ladies and gentlemen: It is not my intention to dwell on what some of you write about the country and me regarding specifically the Zairean economy. Remember that when I addressed my people on 24th April 1990, the exchange rate of the Zaire currency was 1 dollar to 535 old zaires. Today, 1 dollar is exchanged for 6,500 to 7,000 new zaires, that is about 21 million old zaires. If the president of the republic has been maintained in power by the transitional constitution - the first state institution - we must not lose sight of the fact that the exercise of power is divided among all the transitional institutions and that the day-to-day management of public affairs is the responsibility of a government led by an opposition leader. This decision was made in the Marble Palace-1 Accords in October 1991. In this deplorable situation of the Zairean economy, the responsibility of the so-called sovereign national conference is not to be neglected. Furthermore, the conflict between the Republic of Zaire and the former colonial power, the Kingdom of Belgium, is not to be minimized either. Using its influence as a member of Benelux Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg, NATO and the European Union, Belgium did not miss any opportunity to try and internationalize the Zairean issue with the sole intention of harming the interests of the Zairean people and the public image of their leader. You will remember, ladies and gentlemen, that it was also by the instigation of the same Belgium that an economic and diplomatic embargo has been imposed on Zaire, my country, for seven years now. Thus, some of our partners who have no particular problems with Zaire are involved in this Zaire-Belgium conflict without knowing why and how. Lastly, with the help of wisdom and after a lot of negotiation that resulted in the Marble Palace-1 Accords in October 1991, the overall political compromise of July 1992, and the Kinshasa political conclave of March 1993, all the Zairean politicians at last signed on 11th January 1994 a protocol agreement on the political consultations at the Palais du Peuple. In applying this protocol agreement, a parliament was set up, a transitional constitution was adopted and promulgated and finally, a transitional government was set up. This provided a unique institutional framework that is recognized and accepted by all. Zaire is resolutely engaged in the path of completing its democratization process. The setting has been completed. We are only left with making the institutions function in accordance with the transitional constitution in order to lead the people within the slated period to free, transparent and democratic elections. Ladies and gentlemen: As you all know Zaire, my country, occupies an important place in Central Africa, but the reports on our continent speak of serious conflicts and civil wars that have serious repercussions on our national territory. I am referring more particularly to the serious conflicts in Rwanda and Burundi, which have cast a tragic shadow over the Economic Community of the Countries of the Great Lakes; the civil war in Sudan; a serious threat of armed conflict between Sudan and Uganda; and finally, the civil war in Angola. Leading the way concerning all these events, Zaire has always worked towards the re-establishment of peace in the subregion and along our borders. Unfortunately, despite our efforts, all these conflicts have prompted an influx of refugees in Zaire. This has been caused by the civil wars in Rwanda and Burundi, which have driven into Zaire, in conditions that everyone knows, over two million refugees. However, because the international community has opened up camps for the Rwandan and Burundian refugees, thanks to Zaire's hospitality, the international community seems to be disinterested in the problem. In such cases, it is habitually the international community that assumes the first responsibility of the damages caused by the massive exodus of the population looking for a land passage indistinct on its territory by foreigners, as if the international organizations were not meant for that purpose. Zaire's problems compounded by presence of refugees Ladies and gentlemen: Zaire is certainly facing political and economic difficulties that are compounded by the massive presence of refugees on its territory. However, despite the destruction of the environment, especially the ecology and the road and airport infrastructure, Zaire remains, thanks to the generosity of its people and its enormous natural and human potential, a land of hope. That is why I continue to appeal to the Zairean political class to transcend this sectorial, protracted and trivial division to hasten our march towards the rapid installation of the Third Republic. In conclusion, faithful to its policy of opening onto the world, we would like to cooperate with every peace and freedom-loving country, and every international financial organization for the promotion of its integral development. Thank you. Elections are the solution to the crisis in Zaire Jean Valere Mbinamanza, director of information for Africa No 1 Thank you, Mr President. You yourself have preceded us to state that Zaire is in a difficult situation because politically - you also pointed it out - the democratic process is not making progress. The country is also in a difficult situation because economically, its condition is very delicate. The economy is in shambles, and while touring the country and mainly Kinshasa, the capital, one can note that many companies were forced to shut down as a result of the prevailing poor economic situation. Furthermore, Zairean civil servants have not received their salaries for many months. Now, what we would like you to do here is to explain this kind of paradox. I say paradox because politically, you have at your disposal a large number of officials with long-standing experience, mainly concerning the management of public property. I also say paradox in the economic sector, because, as everyone knows, Zaire has very considerable resources. Some people even described your country as a geological scandal in view of its abundant mineral resources. Mr President, can you be more clear on this paradox? Mobutu I think I partly answered this question in my brief introduction. The transition that we began last year words indistinct (?ended) on 9th July this year, and for reasons I do not want to mention during this interview, my country's political circle deemed it necessary to be extended by some 24 months. To avoid complicating the situation and to avoid people accusing Mobutu - as they are used to saying and doing - I agreed to the request and signed the ordinance extending the transition by 24 months. The solution to this crisis, the only solution is to go to the elections so that the people give their verdict, so that at the head of state, government and other institutions of the republic there can be officials chosen - that is, elected by the people themselves. When there is in my country's political circle - and I am sorry to say it - a group of people unwilling to go to the elections immediately and for whom it is necessary to beat about the bush continually words indistinct . I think that within the 24 months of transition - we have already spent two months and I repeat, within these 24 months - we will have to organize the elections at all levels so that we finish with this situation once and for all. Once the elections are held and confidence is restored, in my humble opinion, the state apparatus will be able to function. Political divisions in Zaire Mbinamanza Thank you Mr President, for this first answer. You want free and open elections to end this difficult situation, but can elections be organized in an atmosphere marred by two political camps sharing the national political life? On the one hand, Etienne Tshisekedi is there loudly demanding the post of prime minister, because he was elected by a sovereign decision of the national conference. On the other, we have Kengo wa Dondo, who was elected prime minister and who is ruling the country along with you. Now, Mr Kengo is rejected by a large number of Zairean politicians. How do you envisage organizing free and open elections in such an atmosphere? Mobutu I said open elections, but according to me, what does this mean? When I refer to my recent Christmas and New Years message, I can say that first of all I appealed to the United Nations and then to other appropriate international institutions to come and assist us . This is something that happens almost everywhere. You talk about the prevailing atmosphere. Let me take the example of a neighbouring country - I mean Angola. In a country being bombarded and confronted with arms trafficking as well as all related problems, the United Nations had succeeded - along with the United States - in organizing elections, and the results are recognized. You talk about the atmosphere, but the atmosphere remains what it is. Well, you also talk about Zaire's political life, which is marked by two political camps. Remember that in my 24th April 1990 address to the nation concerning the country's political future, I called for the establishment of three political parties - not more than that - to avoid chaos and anarchy. Unfortunately, I was not supported. This suggestion I made was immediately described as a dictatorial one. So, what did I do in October of the same year? I called for a meeting of political leaders from all tendencies and said: Well, because according to you my suggestion is dictatorial, now each of you is free to found his own party. As a result, instead of the three parties that I called for, presently, we have more than 400. Well, people will tell me that having 400 parties presently means democracy . Of course not! Furthermore, what do we note? Instead of 400, there are coalitions, and these coalitions as you say, have given birth to two major political camps - that is, on the one hand the FPC Political Forces of the Conclave, which supports my policy and the way I view the situation. On the other hand, you have the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allies, the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Affiliated Parties and others. Well, I do not dare to elaborate. Here we now have this difficult situation. I called for three parties, they founded 400, and finally came back down to two major political camps. Now, who is right or wrong? Only the people are in a position to give the right answer to this question. Robert Minangoua, France Soir' Mr President, in the same vein, I would like to ask you: When are these general elections going to take place? Can you give us a date? Mobutu Well, I think I told you here that within the 24 months of transition, which has already begun - I repeat within these 24 months - pauses I mean, the first transition ended on 9th July, while the new one began on 10th July. You can make the calculation yourself. In other words, 10th July plus two years. ""I have nothing to do with the candidacy of a prime minister"" Denise Epothee Durant, French TV5 Mr President, despite this troubled climate, we note with surprise a rapprochement with Etienne Tshisekedi, and that shows your willingness to come closer to the opposition. Or is this a opportunist alliance that is aimed at reducing the freedom of movement of the current prime minister who, as one of my colleague said, has no national support up to now? Mobutu Madam, I will give you some clarification that will enable you to better understand what is happening. As far as Mr Tshisekedi is concerned - or Mr Kengo, the current prime minister - it is not my role to designate a prime minister. The prime minister is supposed to be - and this in line with the accords signed by the political parties - designated by the opposition group and not by the other political group of which the head of state is a member. The opposition presented its candidate to me, I took note and I signed the decree that was published. Therefore, it is the candidate designated by the opposition who becomes the prime minister of the republic. This is what should have been done with Etienne Tshisekedi, but it was done with Kengo. It is not easy in this country to say if one is popular or not as long as we do not go to the polls. Therefore, Kengo's candidacy was presented before parliament, there were elections, he was elected, and he was a candidate coming from the opposition. The opposition did its job and I did mine. My role consisted in taking note and signing the decree. Thank you, madam. Mbinamanza Mr President, you just said that it was not up to you to designate a prime minister, that it was the role of the opposition to nominate one on a consensus basis. However, we remember that you said that with Etienne Tshisekedi you could solve 80 per cent of Zaire's problems. Mobutu I do not know if this is a question you are asking, dear brother, or if this is an advocacy for the candidates who want to be prime ministers, and my answer will always be the same. If you are told tomorrow or the day after tomorrow that a Zairean citizen was nominated prime minister, this would not be the problem of President Mobutu. It is the opposition that proposes its candidate for me to endorse the request. I have nothing to do with the candidacy of a prime minister, and as far as the special arrangements made by the various candidates are concerned, it has been agreed that the prime minister should always be appointed from an opposition political group other than the one to which the head of state belongs. This is very clear. Please ask the brothers of the opposition. They are free not to re-elect Kengo, who also came from the opposition, and they are free to elect Etienne Tshisekedi. The political groups should meet and come up with the name of Tshisekedi or anyone else who will be appointed prime minister, and the decree will be published and promulgated. Let us not beat about the bush. Mark Bedugaud, French LCI TV You, who have had full power for so long, how do you personally live with this forced cohabitation? Mobutu I adapt myself to the situation for the sake of the democratic process. I adapt myself to this new situation and this does not especially bother me. I believe in the future of the country and tomorrow, we will have new institutions, a new constitution that will be different from the provisional constitutional we have now. We have to present a draft constitution to the parties because the current constitution - and I am not ashamed to say this - is indigestible for every one of us. There are French nationals among us today. Do you know what President Mitterrand told me one day in 1993 in Mauritius at the Francophone countries'summit? And this in front of two colleagues and heads of state who are now both dead? They are the former Burundian and Rwandan heads of state. He said: Mobutu, tell me, do you really understand your constitution? As a jurist myself, I am trying to read and understand it and this is no easy task. He told me this in front of witnesses. So you see, this is an indigestible constitution. The simple act of reading it makes you get indigestion. Laughter Noel Yao, Abidjan Reveil' and La Nouvelle Republique' Mr President, if you will allow me, I would like to come back to the responsibility of the various Zairean political factions in what is commonly called the degradation process on various levels in the country. You yourself named some of these factions, but you have been running the country since 1965. Do you think you have no responsibility whatsoever in this situation? Mobutu Let us be clear here. My responsibility is to supervise the smooth running of the institutions without meddling in what is going on in each of these institutions. This should be clear... Jean Chatin, L'humanite' Mr President, could you provide some information on Mr Gizenga? As far as I know, where the Unified Lumumbist Party leader is being held under house arrest is still being kept secret. Also, as far as I know, the reasons for his arrest have never been made public. Mobutu I am perhaps going to surprise you by saying that you astonish me when you claim he is being kept at a secret place. This is very astonishing because Mr Gizenga is being treated fairly, and I think no harm will come to him. I will tell you right away that Gizenga was arrested in 1961 and was to be tried, and only heaven knows what fate would have befallen him. It was I who saved him from that difficult situation. Then, I asked him to go to his native Kwilu, but he preferred to go to Kisangani, and you know the rest. It was his way of thanking me. If you go to ask him today if the president saved his life in 1961, he will say without hesitating, Yes . He was with Mr Mandungu-Bula Nyati, the present leader of the Nationalist Common Front. As I am here to drive home the point, in answer to your question I am stating that no harm will come to him... Relations with Belgium, France, USA Michel Chris, Belgian VTM TV You do not have ideal relations with the Belgium government. Do you have better relations with Belgian opposition parties or powerful opposition politicians? Mobutu I have a lot of friends in your country. You know it too well. I have friends in the government as well as in the opposition. What I deplore is the way Zaire is being hounded. Everywhere, warnings are being given about Zaire. People were even warned against attending a minisummit at Gbadolite, here in Zaire. Chris Mr President, regarding Mr Kengo's programme, I would like to ask a question relating to the Zairean economy. We have arrived at this chapter, which is important for your country's future. I would like to know your feelings on the planned privatization of companies like General Quarries and Mines Company Gecamines and other key companies, which constitute the country's backbone. Don't you have the impression that Zaire is trying to sell off cheaply these family jewels? Similarly, there is talk of bringing Afrikaner farmers, the Boers, and those who propped up apartheid to work in Zaire's agricultural sector. Mobutu Let me take the question of privatization first. You would like to know how I feel? This is what I feel deeply within me: we should not decide the fate of important companies like Gecamines and others during the transitional period. This matter should be left to the government, which will be formed after the elections. That's all. Concerning the Afrikaners, it is not true to say that they have been invited to Zaire. They rather asked to come to Zaire, to settle in Zaire and to have lands in Zaire. If the government has said Yes, I am not opposed to Zaire being open to the external world. I don't see the harm in their coming to settle here... Abnan Zaka, French news agency AFP Do you think that France for instance, like Belgium, is interfering in Zaire or can you sum up current Franco-Zairean relations? Mobutu I will probably not sum up, but I will make an observation. As you are aware, in 1991 looting erupted and there was disorder in Zaire. To evacuate their nationals, the Belgians and the French agreed to team up together. They asked the Americans to assist them and they put in place all that was necessary for the evacuation. In the wake of the evacuation, to my great astonishment, the Belgians, Americans and French agreed to set up what is called the Troika to monitor the situation in Zaire. Dear friend, I don't need to boast about myself here, but everyone finally realized that it was against Zaire's independence and sovereignty, and as the Zairean head of state, I said: No. That was why, you will remember, I did not participate in the 50th anniversary celebration of your country's liberation. I was asked to receive the Troika's ambassadors. For me, there is no edifice, organization or institution above me, the head of state, which administers Zaire. I said No for the following reasons: first, my ambassador in Brussels was brushed aside and then I was asked to receive the Troika - that is, the Belgian, French and US ambassadors. To sum up, that was what happened, and after all it can be observed that the Troika does not exist. Mbinamanza Mr President, kindly allow us to insist a little bit more on this aspect of your relations with your traditional partners, especially Belgium. This initiative you talk about was shared by France and the United States, even if it started with Belgium. However, you seem to put only Belgium in the dock. Are you not thereby expressing your personal resentment against Belgium due to the fact that Belgium was Zaire's colonial power. Mobutu Well, you are perhaps right in saying so. I'm attacking the one who took the initiative, which culminated in the birth of the Troika because there were other former colonial subjects like us. To recolonize us, three countries got together to monitor what is happening in Zaire. The three have not got together to monitor what is going on in Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania or Cote d'Ivoire, or to monitor what is happening between Bedie and Ouattara. They got together solely for Zaire. Why? Minangoua Mr President, from your remarks one gets the impression that you are, in fact, a head of state in the dock of the international community and foreign nations as a whole. Recently, you visited Monaco, where you met President Chirac. Until now, you were virtually banned from France. You were refused visas. Today, can you come back to France, and what will you be telling Jacques Chirac? Mobutu Let the past belong to the past. I talked of the Troika, and you are talking of the international community. Well, that is going too far, my dear friend. Can three states come together and decide the fate of a sovereign state? You see the international community, in my humble opinion, is represented by the United Nations. In fact, the United Nations has just invited me to speak before it on 23rd October as part of activities marking the golden jubilee of the world body. You see, my dear friend, this contradicts what you are saying. The same United Nations invited me in May to Copenhagen, and asked me to take the floor, (?which I did). Minangoua With your permission, in your introductory remarks you condemned Belgium, which is pressurizing other EU member countries to block cooperation, for instance, with Zaire - Mobutu - interrupting Indeed, that's right. I am not here as head of state with rights of reservation to (?openly comment) on certain situations because, when people send me special envoys to tell me: We do not understand what is happening, we want to do this or that; and then they intervene - pauses There are lot of things to be said. What I said was merely for the introduction, and (?did not bring out everything). Minangoua Mr President, it is not my intention to penetrate the secrets of diplomacy. However, you have just said that people send you emissaries. President Jacques Chirac did so when he was about to embark on his African tour last July, and when I asked him on 14th July why he did not wish to meet you, he said he had sent you an emissary with a message. Do you think that President Chirac's action was a friendly one which proves that, in reality, France is not a party to the talked about diplomatic isolation and that one day relations between France and Zaire will become normal once more? Mobutu What do you mean by one day? I think that (?henceforth), things are going to go better, if not much better. I have told them that I was not going to disclose state secrets to anybody. What I am telling you, in other words, is that in my thinking the Troika does not exist. Relations between France and Zaire are good. Minangoua What are your reasons for saying so? What are the signs today which prove you right? Mobutu My dear friend, before the elections I maintained contact by telephone with President Chirac, who is a great friend of mine, as you should know. Be informed that after his election we spoke on the telephone. When I returned from words indistinct we spoke (?in a suite.) Now that we have spoken, things will get much better. That's all. Minangoua Did you meet him privately? Mobutu - laughing Well, no. Minangoua Without seeking to push the issue too far, Mr President, I would like to ask you this: Paris, Brussels, New York - Mobutu - interrupting Washington. Minangoua That's right, Washington. Which of the three capitals would you choose? Mobutu I have no diplomatic choice to make. My country's foreign policy, as I stated a short while ago, is based on openness to the world. We Zaireans must remain friends to everyone. Now, if you take a group like the Francophone community, Zaire's (?friends) within that group, for instance, are something one cannot ignore... Removal of Monsignor Monsengwo Amissi Kilo, Semaine de Reporters', Zaire Mr President, with the permission of my colleagues of Africa No 1, I just want step back a little to the local political front, with particular reference to the issue of Monsignor Monsengwo. He was rejected by a portion of the political camp to which you belong and by a portion of the opposition . You have never commented on the issue. As the guarantor of the smooth functioning of institutions, we would like you to state your views on the matter once and for all. Last, my question on foreign policy is related to the situation unfolding throughout the eastern border. We note that over there our friends of the countries to the east of Zaire do not really seem to be making things easy for us, some in terms of the statements they make and others on account of their implementation of policies that can pose obstacles to our country's domestic policy, particularly the decision adopted by our government. As the most elderly statesman of the Economic Community of Countries of the Great Lakes CEPGL and, as far as I know, current chairman of that community, how do you plan to get involved personally in the search for final solutions to the problems that are being faced, particularly regarding the refugee question and security questions? Without anticipating the content of your discussions with Mrs Ogata, I would like to know how you intend to handle this refugee problem with the UNHCR? Mobutu You referred to the removal of Mgr Monsengwo by a portion of the opposition, as you said, and the majority in parliament. I believe that our institutions function within the spirit of the Constitutional Act, which governs us words indistinct . Each institution is independent on the others. On that point, I repeat emphatically that (?I cannot) interfere in the organization or functioning of any institution whatever. (?Concerning) the High Council of the Republic - Transitional Parliament HCR-PT, it would even be silly on my part to say that I am unaware of what happened. I am aware of everything that transpired. Things developed in stages, up to the removal of Mgr Monsengwo as HCR-PT chairman. I really don't know - pauses First, at the time we did not yet have the Constitutional Deed, I told them that it was important to elect the head of the institution. Instead of being elected, he was selected by acclamation. Now, find out who proposed that he be selected by acclamation to make him unanimously acceptable. (?However) the existing Constitutional Deed somehow prohibits interventions of the kind words indistinct . Now, in your second question you wonder what I will be telling Mrs Ogata. I am going to listen to her. She is the one who asked to see me. I will listen to her and I will react by raising questions (?which may arise from what she will tell me) and issues of what is done with sister countries and at the borders words indirect . Personally, I believe there are criteria to be followed and stands to be taken. I remember telling you a short while ago that I am 67 years old. I cannot behave like just anybody at all; otherwise, I would lose all respect as the most elderly statesman of the CEPGL. In spite of our action in France words indistinct, I made a great deal of moves for the CEPGL. I even received emissaries in the process. Do not think that all that happens is what you see on the television or hear on the radio. It is on those bases that you judge my activities, but that must not be so. Concerning the great lakes region, I received emissaries. I have given my views, which have been upheld and, before I left France I was contacted by various parties and international organizations and I did my job. I may even add that I did so to the satisfaction of a considerable number of those who approached me... ""I will run for president, the people will decide"" Mbinamanza...Mr President, at a time when the transition period is coming to an end, at a time when Zaireans are already preparing for the elections, are you planning to run in the presidential race? This is the first question. The second question is on economy because we have to conclude now. You presented the image of a country that received the approbation of the International Monetary Fund, which wrote to you to say that the economic situation in Zaire had improved somewhat. However, all throughout this interview, Mr President - and since you had the opportunity to talk about the economic situation in your country - you did not give us any details on the economic efforts that would put the Zairean economy back on the right track. Mobutu I can answer your question. In one short sentence some minutes ago, I told you that you should avoid confusing issues. It is not the head of the government who is talking to you and the international media. It is the head of state. It is clearly said in the constitution that the running of state affairs depends on the government. I want this to be very clear. You should ask your questions in line with what is contained in the provisional constitution. The day-to-day state affairs are the responsibility of the government, and the man you are talking to is the head of state. The government is led by a prime minister who is the head of government. I already drew your attention two or three times on this fact, and please, stop confusing matters. As for the second question, I repeated this for maybe the 40th time to the international media. Your colleague seated on your right asked the same question in Biarritz. That was about - Mbinamanza - interrupting That was about 10 months ago Mr President . I think it was last November. Mobutu Almost nine months. I have already answered this question. I will run for president, the people will decide. Mbinamanza Thank you, Mr President. To follow tradition, before parting, I would like to ask two small questions, because you reckoned the fact that you share responsibility for the management of the country and that this country's economy - a country which is overflowing with immense natural resources - is completely devastated today. Zaire is sinking. Do you really intend to make the gesture everybody is expecting from you? It is said that you are a very wealthy man. Do you intend to inject part of your fortune into this country's economy, Mr President? Mobutu My dear friend, I allow you to ask questions but do not use your microphone as a means of propaganda against the head of state of this country. I absolutely forbid you to do this. You have no right to do that. You have the right, as a journalist, to ask questions, to know the truth and only that. First of all, I already said this to your colleague, I will run in the presidential race. I repeated several times that I was 65 years old. A 65-year-old man, and I will be 70 in five years. He should plan, he should prepare the future of his country. The issue here is not to say simply that after 30 years of power, I should remain to power until I die. No. The future should be well planned. African No 1 is asking me words indistinct but should not interfere in Zairean internal affairs. Your microphone should be used to ask questions that will serve the national, African and international community. However, through some media tricks and subtlety, you should not try to interfere in Zaire's internal affairs . This is uncalled for. You are speaking of wealth. You often go to Europe, you read a lot and you swallow everything the foreign media says about African leaders. Personally, I know that - pauses Let us take, for example, the issue of the Troika. Zaire shares borders with nine neighbouring countries. Out of the nine countries, you have four which do not even have a parliament, where no-one votes. These countries in which a parliament does not even exist are sometimes at war but people go there. For Zaire, they need a Troika. Why? Because they are aware of the fact that we do not accept being (?bullied). We are nationalists who defend the sovereignty of their fatherland. Because of this, they called us names. That is the reality. This is my answer. In future - and this is a recommendation - refrain from interfering in our internal affairs. We Zaireans are used to quarrelling, but we will always manage to patch up. Mbinamanza Thank you, Mr President. We had no intention of offending you or interfering in Zaire's internal affairs.

Heavy fighting follows - Aid workers hide in their homes for a second day as Zairean troops loot Goma - 700,000 refugees flee to Mugunga camp - the world's largest - Rwandans flee from border as Gisenyi is hit by mortars from Zaire - Witchhunt against Tutsis in Zairean capital Kinshasa. Many flee to Congo - 100 foreigners, mostly missionaries, shelter from looting Zairean troops in Bukavu cathedral. Banyamulenge rebels take control of town. - Zaire assembly votes to break relations with Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and expel all Tutsis - UN calls for regional summit. Rwanda and zaire refuse RWANDAN government troops in uniform last night entered the eastern Zairean town of Goma, dramatically escalating the political crisis in the region where more than 1 million refugees are on the move. Sadako Ogata, the head of the United Nations' refugee agency, fears a disaster greater than that of 1994, when about 50,000 newly-arrived Rwandan refugees died of epidemics in stinking, overcrowded camps in eastern Zaire. Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda are all now threatened with the escalation of an ethnic war which began as two local struggles between bands from the ill-disciplined and unpaid Zairean army and longtime Tutsi residents in eastern Zaire. Calls for a ceasefire and a regional summit by the UN, the European Union, and aid agencies working among the refugees were dismissed by the main players, Zaire and Rwanda, yesterday. At the UN, Zaire's charge d'affaires, Lukabu Khabouji, said after the Security Council had called for an immediate ceasefire that Zaire will not attend peace talks until Rwandan soldiers had withdrawn. Ethnic hatred spread west as far as the Zairean capital, Kinshasa, yesterday with a witchhunt against prominent Tutsis in the business community. Dozens fled to neighbouring Congo. A mob of several hundred demonstrators attacked and looted Tutsi-owned property in the capital, stealing dozens of cars, according to a Reuters Television cameraman, Marc Hoogsteyns. ""I saw them smash the windows of two shops said to be owned by Tutsis in central Kinshasa and loot a beer truck,"" he said. ""They were driving around in dozens of stolen cars."" Zaire's parliament called for the expulsion of all Tutsis from the country and the breaking of relations with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda - accused of backing the Tutsi rebellion. In eastern Zaire, witnesses on the Rwanda-Zaire border at Gisenyi said mortars were fired first from the Zairean side of the border. Thousands of people fled in panic and Rwandan troops began to return fire. In Goma, the base for aid agencies feeding more than 1 million Rwandan Hutus and their families since they fled after the genocide in 1994, foreign residents cowered in their homes. Civilians streamed out of the town as Zairean troops looted it before the Rwandan army arrived by boat over the lake and heavy fighting erupted. Last night, Tutsi rebels were battling for control of Goma's airport, and the Medecins sans Frontieres aid charity said 100 aid workers, including six of its staff, had been stranded by the fighting. Further south, the Zairean army was finally routed in the town of Bukavu. Heavily armed uniformed Tutsi rebels took control and civilians began to trickle back yesterday, according to a Reuter journalist, Corinne Dufka, who had been trapped inside the town for two days. They were well-disciplined, well-organised and set up checkpoints throughout the town, she reported. Rebel commanders said they are Zairean and speak a variety of languages including Swahili, Lingala, French and English. Ms Dufka's account contradicted the claim by Zaire's prime minister, Leon Kengo Wa Dondo, that Bukavu was back under government control. He also claimed control of nearby Uvira. Yesterday in Uvira, the scene of an early success by the Tutsi rebels, the leader of the rebellion, Laurent Kabila, claimed the war was a battle for the soul of all Zaire. Mr Kabila, wearing a safari suit, sat in his rebel headquarters, the front room of which passes for a grand house in Uvira - one of the first towns he seized after launching his offensive two weeks ago. ""Our objectives are clear,"" he said. ""We are fighting for a vast movement to put an end to this useless state that no longer exists. ""There is no power at the top. We want to overthrow the irresponsible clique of people in power to put in place a transitional government which would eventually organise democratic elections."" Mr Kabila heads the ""Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo -Zaire"" - his supporters are keen to point out the significance of the name. This not only claims to be a national movement, but one that harks back to before President Mobutu Sese Seko changed the country's name. Mr Kabila insists it is not a movement merely born of a backlash by Zaire's Banyamulenge Tutsis against increasingly vicious persecution by their own government and Hutu refugees from Burundi and Rwanda. At his headquarters, Mr Kabila introduced other rebel leaders, including one with a cellular phone hooked up to neighbouring Burundi. France has added its voice to those accusing Rwanda of backing the rebellion, but Mr Kabila denies receiving any foreign assistance. There are hints otherwise. Some of his troops wear the Rwandan army's familiar Wellington boots, rarely seen among other soldiers in the region. In contrast with the disciplined force reported to have taken Bukavu, the rebel soldiers in Uvira were not impressive. There was the usual guerrilla mismatch of uniforms. With the pendulum of military control appearing to swing in favour of the rebels, confusion and panic among the refugees mounted. ""At one point yesterday we had refugees on the road walking in both directions,"" said Panos Moumtzis, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Goma. ""They are really panicking. They are very scared. They do not know where to go."" UN officials and foreign aid workers said already appalling conditions in the refugee camps - including Mugunga, with an estimated 500,000 people - were worsening. Food and water shortages are compounded by a growing public health problem - and terror. A UNHCR spokeswoman, Ruth Marshall, reported continuing attacks by Tutsis on refugee camps in eastern Zaire, provoking panic in terrible conditions. ""People are slopping around in shit - it is heading towards catastrophe,"" she said. More than 100,000 refugees and local Zairean residents were making their way south from Kahindo to Mugunga camp. The camp is out of the control of the international agencies. Bodies are regularly found; guns and grenades can be bought with ease; and the majority of refugees are kept in a state of fear by the killers to prevent them returning to Rwanda. Nearly 200,000 refugees were yesterday making their way to Mugunga after their camp at Kibumba had been attacked and burnt by Banyamulenge forces. Ian Bray, Oxfam's spokesman, described the situation as ""basically, mayhem"". Thousands of refugees were moving west into Zaire but aid workers were unable to keep track of them. Some were moving north towards Goma, others who had been attacked by Tutsis were moving south of Uvira towards the Fizi Plain. But, Mr Bray added, ""no one really knows where people are going"". Oxfam issued a statement saying the Geneva Convention on behaviour in war was being torn up in Zaire and told the international community that central Africa was heading for a ""firestorm of instability"". Oxfam accused politicians of ""failing to do their job"" and of using the huge humanitarian effort in the area triggered by the previous Rwandan crisis as a substitute for political action. * EU ministers have been invited to meet in Brussels next Thursday to discuss emergency humanitarian support for the refugees caught in the fighting in eastern Zaire, the current holder of the EU presidency, Ireland, said yesterday.","""1996-11-02T00:00:00Z""","""3TDG-WH10-006X-B28G-00000-00"""

Over half of eligible voters stayed home and those who did cast ballots refused to give either party a majority. Voter initiatives were at record levels suggesting citizens were desperate to outflank their legislators. Many of those who didn't vote blamed the relentless flow of attack advertising bought with fishy campaign money. ""Who would want to go near any of them,''  asked Stephanie Howard, of Greenville, S.C. She did not cast a ballot. The turnout at the polls was the lowest in 72 years. A projection by Voter News Service suggested that only 49 per cent of the voting age population cast ballots. That means 90 million Americans did not feel compelled to cast a ballot. There were double-digit drops in turnout in some states. Voter turnout was 55 per cent four years ago. --- MOSCOW - A day after his quintuple heart bypass, Boris Yeltsin reasserted his tenacious grip on power and demanded a report on what went on while he was unconscious. He also nagged doctors to move him out of the Moscow Cardiological Clinic to cozier surroundings. ""I think he's out of the woods,''  American heart surgeon Michael DeBakey said after seeing Yeltsin. Yeltsin's wife told Russia's Public Television that her husband was experiencing some post-surgical pain, but was in much better shape when she visited him Tuesday. Doctors were considering moving him to the nearby Kremlin hospital, which has suites of offices and a homier atmosphere. --- GOMA, Zaire - The plight of 1.1 million refugees in Zaire worsened although the country's ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko backed a multinational force to bring them relief and help them go home. Rebels who have seized control of key towns in eastern Zaire are resisting the idea. At his headquarters in rebel-held Bukavu, rebel leader Laurent Kabila said his forces would not accept non-African troops and that any international force should consist of soldiers from countries in the region. No quick relief was in sight for the teeming masses of refugees. Zairian aid workers were unable to reach Mugunga, the world's largest refugee camp near the rebel-held eastern Zairian town of Goma. After a meeting at Mobutu's French Riviera villa, UN envoy Raymond Chretien quoted the Zairian president as saying he would do his utmost to maintain calm in Zaire to let a multinational force work. Chretien is Canada's ambassador to the United States and a former ambassador to Zaire. --- LONDON - Don MacGregor may have had a stroke of luck in his quest to recover medals awarded to his late father, Jock, one of Canada's most decorated First World War soldiers.

./samples/,"From Reuters-AP KINSHASA, Zaire (CP) - Zairian rebel leader Laurent Kabila said today he is taking over as head of state with agreement of generals in Kinshasa, and he expected the capital to be under his control in hours. Only hours after President Mobutu Sese Seko fled the capital on his way to almost certain exile, Rebels walked down the streets toward the centre of Kinshasa in large numbers, witnesses said. Gunfire flared around the capital and people took to the streets throughout the city. ""Don't call them rebels, call them liberators!''  one Kinshasan cried in a crowd marching downtown. Miguel Kamputu, 18, rolled on his back on the sidewalk, shouting, ""Oh Kabila! Oh Kabila!''  then shaking with laughter. ""Too much suffering. Too much suffering. He is finally here,''  he said. As the rebel advance became apparent, confusion erupted in the capital city of five million, with some troops fleeing and civilians picking up and firing abandoned weapons. One civilian strode down the street, cigarette dangling from his lip and a grenade launcher swinging on his hip. A crowd outside the hotel walked several blocks to the central market, encountering about 25 Zairian troops. As the youths drew near, waving white handkerchiefs, the soldiers fired into the air, then left. Two people were killed, but it was unclear how they died. Kabila, in a statement read at a news conference in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi, said: ""Mr. Laurent Desire Kabila assumes from today the functions of the head of state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.''  The rebels have declared rebel-held areas of Zaire as the Congo, reverting to the name used after independence in 1960 before Mobutu declared the country should be known as Zaire from 1971. Kabila said earlier that his forces, numbering about 10,000, were marching on the capital from the airport about 25 km away. He said he had just spoken to army generals in Kinshasa and they had assured him all the military were willing to pledge allegiance to the newly declared government headed by the rebel chief. ""According to reports from the generals, everyone was ready to take orders from me,''  he said. At 11 a.m. Kinshasa time, all Zairian soldiers should lay down their arms in front of rebel forces, he added. Kabila, who opposed the dictator Mobutu for more than 30 years, said he expected his forces to have complete control of Kinshasa within hours. He said he would form a transitional government of public salvation within 72 hours and a constituent assembly within 60 days. ""Our first column is entering the city and we expect to have the city under control by tonight. We want to move rapidly so that lawlessness does not get out of hand,''  Kabila's foreign affairs spokesman, Bizima Karaha, told Reuters by telephone from rebel headquarters in Lubumbashi. Mobutu's exact whereabouts and plans remained unclear. Aides said Friday he flew to his northern hometown of Gbadolite, 1,100 km away, for a few days ""rest''  and refused to say he had left Kinshasa for good. But diplomatic sources said they expected the 66-year-old Mobutu, who is dying from prostate cancer, to continue on to Morocco to begin life in exile. Meanwhile, Mobutu's soldier son, Capt. Kongolo Mobutu, arrived in Congo's capital Brazzaville today on board a speed boat with around 20 other men, witnesses said. Earlier, western military sources said army chief Gen. Marc Mahele Lieko Bokungu - one of the top generals who on Thursday advised Mobutu that troops would not defend the capital and that he should leave - was killed about midnight Friday by a Zairian soldier. One of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mahele was accused of being a traitor and shot. Mobutu's decision to cede control of his government came after months of cajoling by his former allies, who had seen his departure as the best way to ensure a transition of power without further bloodshed. Kabila has promised to undo the damage wrought by Mobutu's nearly 32 years in power - to restore order and integrity and hold democratic elections. A government statement, read by Mobutu's information minister at a Friday news conference, said Mobutu retained the title of president but relinquished all power over the handling of state affairs to his government. On Thursday night, Mobutu's top generals told their boss they would not guard the capital against rebel attack, according to western diplomats in Kinshasa. And witnesses said that just hours after Mobutu's flight, they saw Gen. Nzimbi Ngbale, head of the presidential guard, flee Kinshasa for Brazzaville, Congo, in a boat crossing the river separating the two capitals.","""1997-05-17T00:00:00Z""","""4706-3630-01G6-81DT-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Advancing by foot, by jeep and, in their stunning final approach to the unofficial capital of eastern Zaire, by dugout canoe, rebels determined to overthrow the Government now stand poised to capture Kisangani, this country's third-largest city. Foreign diplomats and Zairian military analysts said Kisangani could fall at any moment, giving the rebels the most significant strategic victory in their five-month campaign, and posing the gravest threat to the political survival of Mobutu Sese Seko in his 31 years in power. ""With the fall of Kisangani, the military campaign will be over,"" one Western diplomat said. ""Beyond that point, what we'll have is a victorious road trip,"" he added, explaining that the collapse of the Zairian Army ""has caught the rebels by surprise and they have been moving very fast."" Here in the nation's capital, few people, be they the ordinary citizens who root openly for the rebellion, or foreign diplomats who have watched its advance in astonishment, say the Government can survive very long after the fall of Kisangani. Many, in fact, say that if Kisangani is taken, Kinshasa itself will either rally to the rebellion, bringing the Mobutu era to a close, or ignite in a panic, as happened twice this decade during bouts of widespread looting. The rebels, known as the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, has rejected international pressure for a cease-fire and confidently announced what resembles a plan of their own. ""We are hoping we will win the war and from that point we will have a transitional government for a year,"" said Mwenze Kongolo, the rebels' justice minister. ""After that year we will have general elections."" Along with the fate of Mr. Mobutu, who is in the south of France, where he has spent most of the war undergoing treatment for cancer, the future of as many as 200,000 Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees has been left dangling by the fighting. In recent days, rebel attacks around the refugee camp at Tingi Tingi have sent well over 100,000 Hutu scrambling in search of a safe resting point. Many of them are women and children already sick and severely weakened by months of travel across the Zairian jungle, Rebels who advanced on the camp from the direction of the town of Walikale are said to include substantial numbers of Rwandan Tutsi fighters who have enlisted to help the war effort of the Zairian rebel leader, Laurent Kabila. Diplomats and human rights advocates here described the Rwandan Tutsi as volunteers bent on revenge for the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi by Hutu in Rwanda in 1994. Western diplomats say that as many as 1,000 Hutu fighters from the former Rwandan Army and Hutu militias have lived interspersed with the Tingi Tingi refugees, and fighting between the rival Rwandan elements is believed to have been intense. ""The thesis of these Tutsi is that all of these Hutu are interahamwe,"" or members of the Hutu militia that organized the 1994 massacre, said Guillaume Ngefa Atondo, president of the Zairian Human Rights Association. ""The geography of the fighting indicates a determination to exterminate refugees."" The Zairian Government has accused the rebels of having massacred as many as 25,000 Hutu refugees in recent days. Diplomats and aid workers discount that figure, but say the fate of the refugees is endangered by the uncertainty over whether there will be any relief workers left to help them, after some agencies withdrew workers and the Zairian Government expelled others. Zaire's war began in October, when persecuted Zairian ethnic Tutsi began an uprising in the eastern border region, an assault that diplomats say was strongly supported by Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. In addition to persecuting its own Tutsi minority, who were stripped of their Zairian nationality, Zaire had earned the animosity of its eastern neighbors by allowing Hutu militiamen to mount attacks on Rwanda and Burundi from huge refugee camps in Zaire's east. The rebels' first goal seemed to be breaking up the refugee camps, and pursuing fighters they considered to be Hutu war criminals. But as Government forces collapsed, the leader of the rebellion, Mr. Kabila, a lifelong opponent of Mr. Mobutu, set out to overthrow the Government outright. After weeks during which empty Government declarations of counterattacks and the recapture of fallen positions have become routine, there is now a numbed silence among officials here who seem to sense that the end is nearing. Asked for information about new developments in the war, one senior official said: ""Is there any news today? Give us a break, we need time to digest the loss of Kindu."" After being pillaged by the army, Kindu, a strategic city on the Zaire River 360 miles west of the borders with Rwanda and Burundi, was captured by the rebels last weekend, depriving Government forces of the last remaining airfield from which it could attack the eastern border zones that have been the rebel strongholds. The speed of the rebels' most recent advances, coming after a lull in the war that followed a series of bombing runs by Government aircraft, seems to have taken even close observers of the military situation here by surprise. As the noose has tightened around Kisangani, rebels have advanced on three fronts, overcoming Zaire's famously bad road network and reportedly carrying their own planks to span the damaged bridges that abound in the rainforest. In their most stunning maneuver so far, a rebel group with a strength estimated at 200 to 300 men reached the town of Bengamisa this week, about 25 miles north of Kisangani, overcoming the lack of roads by traveling by canoe down the Lindi River more than 100 miles from the recently fallen town of Bafwasende. The execution of plans like that one has reinforced two impressions about the rebels. The first is that they are not, or are no longer, primarily made up of the Zairian Tutsi from the eastern part of the country who were at the root of the revolt. Everywhere the rebels have traveled, their numbers have swollen, as has their knowledge of the local terrain. Second, military analysts say, the unidentified commander in charge of the rebel campaign, whether Zairian, or more likely Rwandan or Ugandan, is a well-schooled officer and masterful strategist. ""There is an Eisenhower or Montgomery type putting this together: very cautious, very methodical, and very impressive,"" said one Western military expert. ""The approach by river to Kisangani is just one example. It completely cuts off retreat by the Zairian Army."" That fact does not seem to have escaped Zairian forces in Kisangani, a faded diamond-trading center and important Zaire River port that has been battered repeatedly by past army pillages. Residents of the city reached by telephone say tensions are already running extremely high, with soldiers placing their families on flights out of the city and warning merchants of imminent pillage. What makes Kisangani different from all other cities captured by the rebels so far, beyond its size and political importance, is that from the start it has been the center of the Government's war effort, and as such is a major depot for arms and ammunition that would fall into rebel hands along with the city. Kisangani is also the base of 200 to 300 foreign mercenaries, including Serbs, Russians and Ukrainians. The mercenaries have stepped up their activities in recent days, mining approaches to the city and flying ground-attack practice runs in Russian-built helicopters. At the same time, Serbian mercenary pilots have flown the country's three leased fighter jets out of Kisangani as a precaution against their loss, reportedly stationing them in the diamond-producing city of Mbuji Mayi. ""If Kisangani falls, things will get ugly for the Government,"" said Christophe Gbenye, a rebel leader of the 1960's who held the city for five months in 1964. ""It is a whole reign that is passing, and for Mobutu it looks like an exit without glory.""","""1997-03-07T00:00:00Z""","""3SP8-9010-000P-N21T-00000-00"""
./samples/,"By Kevin McElderry KINSHASA, Nov 7 (AFP) - More than 1,000 angry students defied a ban on demonstrations Thursday and called for Zaire's prime minister and cabinet to resign over the crisis in embattled eastern Zaire. Security forces looked on but did not intervene as students gathered at a university faculty for a joint funeral service for two colleagues killed in a demonstration earlier this week. But a threatened march on the Palais des peuples, the seat of Zaire's transitional government, failed to materialise as tight security cordons were thrown up around the parliament building. The students had threatened to bring the corpses to the Palais in a show of force to upset a meeting of the transitional government. Even deputies trying to get to the building were stopped and had their vehicles and identities checked. The two students were killed--one shot dead, the other died in an accident--as some 10,000 people demonstrated Tuesday in the streets of Kinshasa calling on Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo to resign. It was one of the largest rallies for years in the Zairean capital. Thursday, a joint funeral service was held at the Institut National Superieur de Commerce, on a main thoroughfare next to the gendarmerie headquarters. As some 200 students gathered in front of the walled grounds, another crowd of about 1,000 was inside where the two corpses lay in coffins. After a joint mass, the first body, that of Jean-Marie Bangabunda who was shot, was taken away by students of his faculty to be brought to his family. Then, amid a fanfare of drums, trumpets and singing, the coffin of Guylain Mbiya was laid inside a black hearse, bouquets of flowers perched on the roof. Many of the students wore headbands with the words Adieu Guylain. Like the earlier cortege, it was also escorted out by a cavalcade of dangerously overcrowded lorries, vans and cars to be taken to his family. ""Our objective is the departure of Kengo and his government. Kengo is a person of double nationality,"" one student leader said. ""The only answer that the (army) general staff has for me is to try to neutralise Kengo. Then we will have a solution (to the crisis) in eastern Zaire."" Professing their determination to fight the rebels in the east of the country, who they claim are suppored by the Rwandan government, they said all they needed were weapons to fight with. ""None of the students are happy about what is happening. The government is irresponsible. It is doing absolutely nothing."" Both students are to be buried Friday. Kengo is accused by the students of being too soft on the mainly Tutsi rebels, and of being partly of Tutsi origin himself. Thursday's demonstration was the third in a week in Kinshasa following one on Friday and the biggest so far on Tuesday. The students have pledged to continue demonstrating until Kengo stands down. km/job AFP","""1996-11-07T00:00:00Z""","""3TDD-TRT0-0031-V0KY-00000-00"""

There was a denial from the government in Kinshasa yesterday of the reports in the American press: in his letter to President Clinton, Mobutu never said that he intended to resign, the Zairean foreign minister said. The rebel view is that there is no question of a cease-fire: Laurent-Desire Kabila has stated this. His men will continue to advance on Kinshasa until Mobutu resigns. Ghislaine Dupont: [Dupont - recording] The alliance [the rebels'Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire] version of the hand-over of power is contained in nine points. The typed two-page document was handed over to Marshal Mobutu at his meeting with Laurent-Desire Kabila on Sunday [4th May]. The first point provides for a peaceful transfer of power to be carried out by means of a written undertaking signed by Mobutu. A sample letter of resignation, already drafted, is attached to the document. According to this plan Mobutu must also publicly call on his army to lay down its weapons and obey the alliance. Twelve hours later the command of the Zairean army is to present its surrender at Kenge, a town lying 150 km to the east of Kinshasa. Twenty-four hours later the troops of the alliance are to make their official entry into the capital, according to the plan. In the meantime the parliament is to be dissolved and a transitional government to be installed by the alliance. Yesterday the American envoy, Bill Richardson, once again made the journey to Lubumbashi to meet Kabila. The Americans reiterated that they wanted a peaceful hand-over of power.

./samples/,"After a day of relentless confusion, diplomatic efforts to bring President Mobutu Sese Seko and the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, together for shipboard talks fell through this evening when Mr. Kabila stood up his rival, refusing to fly to the vessel for security reasons. Mr. Kabila's decision came after the meeting, which was expected to transfer power between the two men, had been delayed for several hours by Mr. Mobutu and an elaborate improvisation over how to get the ailing Zairian President on board. Mr. Mobutu, who is suffering from advanced cancer and is unable to stand up unassisted, arrived this morning at Pointe-Noire, a Congolese port, but refused to walk up a steep 31-step gangplank to the ship, sending diplomats and his hosts scurrying to devise other solutions. He also refused to board the ship by helicopter, invoking advice from his doctors that the vibrations could harm him. After considering even using a crane to hoist Mr. Mobutu aboard, the ship was maneuvered so he could be driven up a cargo plank in an armored black Cadillac as he waved through dark windows to journalists. It was not clear if Mr. Kabila planned to travel to the ship on Saturday, when diplomats hoped to reconvene. Reports from Luanda, the Angolan capital, where the rebel leader spent much of the day, said that Mr. Kabila was complaining he had not been officially invited to the meetings and that he was concerned about his safety. But diplomats here said Mr. Kabila appeared to get cold feet out of fear that the discussions would require him to form a government not entirely of his choosing. The United States has expressed its desire to see a ""broadly inclusive transitional government"" that could contain members of both Mr. Mobutu's political movement and Zaire's traditional opposition, which the rebel leader has resisted. Tensions were high today in Kinshasa, the Zairian capital, a crowded city of five million, where many feared that word the talks had failed could lead to a panic by Government soldiers, who would then expect an imminent rebel assault. Already the capital's leading hotels have been filling up with wealthy Zairians worried about a possible repeat of violent bouts of pillaging by Government soldiers in 1991 and 1993, which took numerous lives and left much of the city in ruins. ""This is what these talks are all about, avoiding the burning of Kinshasa,"" said one Western diplomat. ""Kabila is coming one way or another. But hopefully it won't have to be with guns blazing."" The breakdown of talks even before they had begun left Mr. Mobutu, President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and President Clinton's special envoy, Bill Richardson, steaming off the Congolese port aboard the Outeniqua, the South African icebreaker chosen as a neutral meeting place. In Washington, Administration officials expressed disappointment and annoyance with Mr. Kabila. ""The U.S. Government is very disappointed, and Kabila's refusal to show is directly contradictory to all the assurances he gave Richardson,"" one official said. ""It just doesn't go over very well."" Many had wondered whether Mr. Mobutu's health would allow him to negotiate at all with Mr. Kabila, the rebel leader whose armies control over two-thirds of Zaire and are now advancing on the capital. From their conception, the talks between Mr. Mobutu and Mr. Kabila, an idea worked upon for weeks by Mr. Mandela, and pushed strongly during Mr. Richardson's shuttle diplomacy of the last few days, have been plagued by strong disagreements over an agenda. Even as Mr. Kabila was waiting for Mr. Mobutu to board the ship, before setting out to join him, his troops, heavily assisted by Angola, have been massing around Kinshasa poised to strike quickly if Mr. Mobutu refuses to resign. Advanced elements of Mr. Kabila's army are now believed to be little more than 100 miles east of Kinshasa, and Western intelligence reports indicated that rebel units were massing to the southwest of the capital, near the Angolan border with Bas-Zaire province. In addition, rebel units were said to be fast moving into position to attack the capital from Tshikapa to the southeast, also near the border with Angola. As if to drive home the point that Mr. Mobutu's political end is at hand, the rebels announced today that they had taken the President's birthplace, the northern city of Lisala, without a fight from Government troops, who looted the town before fleeing. Though widely believed to be nearing death, Mr. Mobutu has been fighting for a departure that would allow him to hand over power with dignity to an interim authority, rather than to Mr. Kabila directly. Deepening the air of uncertainty, close associates of the Mobutu family have said that whether or not the President agrees on anything with Mr. Kabila, his health will not allow him to come back after the talks. The fortunes and leverage of the two sides were reflected today by their supporting casts. Mr. Kabila spent hours meeting in Luanda, Angola, with his two biggest backers, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and Vice President Paul Kagame of Rwanda. Rwanda committed officers, equipment and troops at the earliest stages of Mr. Kabila's uprising, and Western diplomats say Angola has contributed large amounts of cash in recent weeks, as well as tanks and other heavy weapons, and airlift capacity for moving troops around the vast Zairian countryside. Asked what the involvement of the outside countries was about, a member of Mr. Richardson's delegation said, ""Payback, payback, and in Angola's case, diamonds."" Mr. Mobutu has had a large hand in the civil wars of both Rwanda and Angola, and Zaire's support for Angola's rebel movement enabled its leader, Jonas Savimbi, to control most of the border between the two countries, and Angola's lucrative diamond trade. Mr. Mobutu had hoped to bring at least two fellow African heads of state, Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and President Omar Bongo of Gabon, aboard the Outeniqua for moral and political support. But when Mr. Kabila got wind of this, he reportedly threatened to pull out of the discussions, and the plan to bring in other leaders was canceled.","""1997-05-03T00:00:00Z""","""3SP8-7TD0-000P-N3D5-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Rebel leader Laurent Kabila, responding to a plea from the United Nations, said Sunday that he will put off attacking a refugee camp to clear out Rwandans he says are armed by the Zairian government. Kabila said he granted the reprieve to allow the international community time to figure out how to separate armed killers from bona fide refugees. ''As we are Christians, we shall give more time to UNHCR,''  Kabila told The Associated Press. ''We shall see what we come up with.''  Kabila said he didn't set a new deadline, but would stay in touch with U.N. officials. Twice in the past week, Kabila has vowed to attack the Tingi-Tingi refugee camp within days to drive out former Rwandan soldiers and Hutu militiamen who have received planeloads of arms, allegedly from the Zairian government. In Kinshasa on Sunday, Zaire's defense ministry denied that it was arming the Rwandan Hutus and said Kabila's threat was proof that he was being directed by the Tutsi-led governments of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. They have denied it. The United Nations had sent a team to Kalemie, a port on Lake Tanganyika, to ask Kabila to hold off. ''I told them, they have been...feeding killers,''  Kabila said. ''I think it is the international community which will decide what to do, to assist the UNHCR to have a solution. Now it is hopeless, completely. They don't know what to do.''  Representatives of UNICEF and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees flew back to Nairobi, Kenya, without commenting. In the past, the refugee agency has said that it does not have the power to disarm refugees. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan confirmed Friday what the rebels have said for weeks that former Rwandan soldiers and Hutu militiamen are receiving weapons and ammunition by air and are being sent to the front line. Hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutus fled into Zaire after Rwanda's 1994 massacre of a half-million Tutsis, fearing reprisals from the Tutsi-led government that now controls Rwanda. Many of the fighters sheltering in the camps took part in the genocide. They live among innocent women and children. Kabila said he pledged to provide a safe corridor, as he has done in the past, for the 150,000 refugees sheltering in Tingi-Tingi, 130 kilometers (80 miles) southeast of Kisangani, one of the rebels' key targets. The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire has captured at least 1,000 kilometers (900 miles) of eastern Zaire in its campaign to oust President Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila, chairman of the Alliance, said his toughest opposition was coming from the Rwandans, not Zairians, ''because the Zairians are not motivated.''  A helicopter gunship bombed rebel positions near Tingi-Tingi on Saturday, but there were no casualties, Kabila said. Kabila said his troops were advancing towards their targets in the north, south and west but intentionally slowly in order to give the government time to decide to negotiate. He has set a deadline of Feb. 21 for the government to start talking with the rebels. ''The 21st will be the last day for the Alliance officially to talk about political settlement of this,''  Kabila said. ''The other side has no solution, no power to recapture the lost territory...and what is left for them is negotiating with us, otherwise we shall start our second offensive. It is already prepared.''  The rebels insist on the resignation of Mobutu, whose 31 years in power have left mineral-rich Zaire among the world's poorest, most rundown countries. ''No more government of Mobutu and Mobutists, the end of the regime of terror and misery,''  Kabila said. The Alliance wants to install a transitional government that would organize free multi-party elections, monitored by international observers, within six months. After a new president and parliamentarians are elected, they would decide on a new constitution for the second largest country in sub-Saharan Africa. ''The federation is an ideal form of government,''  Kabila said. ''But that is the choice of the people, so the people decide what form of government would be set up.''","""1997-02-16T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-4VN0-00BT-M2XY-00000-00"""

UN High Commissioner for Refugees official Kilian Kleinschmidt said a UN aircraft would set off Sunday to search of the vanished refugees in an area south of Kisangani. ""There is a possibility that the refugees have tried to cross the Zaire River,"" he said. Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila arrived in Kisangani on Saturday, saying he intended to resolve what he called the ""little problem"" of the missing Rwandans. Kabila had a first meeting Saturday with Aldo Ajello, the European Union's special envoy on the Great Lakes region of central Africa, and more talks are set for Sunday. sunday. Questioned about accusations by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan that the rebels had adopted a ""slow extermination"" policy against wandering Rwandan refugees, opting to let them starve to death, Kabila said the charges were ""gratuitous."" ""I was expecting them,"" he continued. ""Let him (Annan) come here to solve the problem. He is making propaganda for the dead. That's all."" International aid bodies have also been strongly critical of the mainly Tutsi rebels, blaming them for the disappearance of the Rwandan Hutu refugees after failing to locate them despite overflying the region on Friday. The refugees, mainly Hutus, came into Zaire from Rwanda in 1984 in the wake of the slaughter of 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu extremists. The rebels, who now control more than half of Zaire, have denied responsibility for the missing refugees, though they are continuing to deny aid officials access to the region to search for the refugees on the ground.

Meanwhile, the commander of the Zairean army's elite special presidential division has ordered his troops to ""fight to the death"" against advancing rebel forces who are reported within a day of Kikwit, the last key line of defence before the capital. General N'Zimbi Ngbale said on television: ""The war is not over. We have to fight to the death to retake the territory taken by the invaders."" The call came as reports, citing religious sources, said that Kabila's forces were set to take the villages of Idiofa and Gungu, 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Kikwit, the economic capital of Bandundu province, and a key point on the main road to Kinshasa some 400 kilometres (250 miles) away. burs/rom AFP US ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson will head to Zaire on a special mission to urge government and rebel leaders to find a peaceful solution to their conflict, the White House announced Saturday.

./samples/,"NICE, France, Dec 17 (AFP) - President Mobutu Sese Seko, one of the last of the old-guard of African strongmen, left his French Riviera villa Tuesday to return home to crumbling Zaire after a four-month absence, officials said. Mobutu was expected to return to a welcome from waiting crowds being marshalled by officials at Kinshasa airport, but that will not mask the chaos in a country no longer fully under his control. Rebels controlling the east of the country are intent on pressing on to Kinshasa and overthrowing the 66-year-old president, whose country did not send a representative to a summit of regional states in Kenya called to discuss the crisis in Zaire. Mobutu, whose isolation in France while his impoverished country was embroiled in civil war has led to widespread discontent, was expected to waste little time in trying to re-assert his authority. The head of state is due to go to the Tshatshi barracks, where his presidential guard is based, to broadcast an address to the nation, which faces a rebellion in the east and political chaos in Kinshasa. Mainly Tutsi rebels have captured a large swathe of eastern Zaire since October, and stated that their eventual aim is to overthrow the 31-year Mobutu regime. Government troops have been routed from towns in North and South Kivu provinces, including the capitals, Goma and Bukavu. Kinshasa accuses Zaire's neighbours, particularly Tutsi-dominated Rwanda, but also Uganda and Burundi, of supporting the rebels. Earlier, a fleet of limousines and a minibus took Mobutu, his wife and entourage from the Roquebrune-Cap-Martin villa to the Cote d'Azur airport at Nice, where the president boarded one of two DC8 airliners chartered by the Zaire government. Two television crews, including a US team, were travelling with him. Mobutu arrived in France on November 4 after undergoing an operation for prostate cancer in Switzerland. He has since been convalescing at his luxury cliff-top villa, where apart from several meetings with visiting officials, he has insulated himself from the chaos sundering his country. He held talks with several regional leaders who visited the villa as well as UN special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Canadian diplomat Raymond Chretien, who urged him to return home to try to bring peace to the region. Mobutu's supporters believe he may be able to lead a counter-offensive in the east to ""boot the enemy across the borders,"" as officials have put it. On the political front, newspapers close to Mobutu's main rival in the past, Etienne Tshisekedi, are being much quieter than usual in denouncing the ""dictator"" and looking for a reconciliation between their leader and the head of state. Tshisekedi's aides argue that the only ""legal"" way out of a political impasse is for the former premier to take back the helm and form a ""national unity government."" Meanwhile, government officials in Zaire were urging people onto the streets of Kinshasa to welcome the ailing leader home. Police and security forces were in place along the 25 kilometre (15 mile) route leading from Kinshasa's Ndili airport to the Tshatshi barracks. The authorities earlier requisitioned buses and trucks to marshall crowds for what the Salongo newspaper on Tuesday forecast would be an ""ecstatic"" welcome. Salongo is close to the government, but other newspapers claimed the welcome would be a carefully stage-managed media event. Even when in the country, public sightings of Mobutu in Zaire are rare. He made a brief visit to Kinshasa in January to commemorate the victims of the air disaster which killed 350 people when a plane crashed into a market near the airport. bur/db/ccr AFP Crowds jostled to catch a glimpse of him, police and soldiers proudly saluted and banners proclaimed his glorious return. For the man at the centre of the acclaim, upright in his open-top car as he acknowledged the thousands of people on the 60-kilometre (40-mile) route home, it could have been the good old days all over again. But as President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire returned to his people after a four-month absence, his country lay economically crippled, his army bloodied and bruised and a chunk of eastern Zaire in rebel hands. From early in the morning, loyal supporters began gathering at junctions, roundabouts and along the road from Kinshasa's airport to Mobutu's official residence at Tshatshi barracks, where his presidential guard is based. Flags flew, banners praised his leadership and schools and markets closed down for the afternoon as the people of Kinshasa mobilised themselves. Eager spectators vied for places on vehicles going to the airport, others jostled for key vantage points en route, and hundreds of schoolchildren were marshalled at a junction normally packed with opposition activists. ""Today is the day of Zaire's liberation from the rebels who are illegally occupying the east of our country,"" one said. Protected by men of the civil guard and the presidential guard, two elite units under Mobutu's direct control, the president took three hours to travel the 60 kilometres from the airport to Tshatshi. He appeared weakened by his August prostate cancer operation and the four months he spent convalescing in Europe, but remained standing alongside his wife in the open-top car. Wearing his traditional leopardskin hat, he never tired of acknowledging the cheers of the crowds. At a crossroads just 500 metres (yards) from the residence, security forces assigned to protect the cortege joined in the welcome. ""We have waited so long and we can't help joining in with the crowds,"" an overwhelmed gendarme said. For all the scenes of celebration, however, it was not clear exactly how many were genuinely pleased to see the president. In some quarteres, notably the poorer areaas of the sprawling capital, indifference reigned. Despite official calls for a mass mobilisation to greet Mobudu, shops and markets there remained open and it was business as usual for the clubs. Earlier Mobutu had gone walkabout immediately after his plane touched down, shaking hands with some of the thousands who had been marshalled to greet him at the airport. Authorities had requisitioned buses and trucks to bring in crowds for what the pro-government Salongo newspaper forecast would be an ""ecstatic"" welcome. Other newspapers claimed it would simply be a carefully stage-managed media event.

./samples/,"Rebel leader Laurent Kabila objected on Sunday to the presence of U.S. troops at Zaire's border, calling it a threat to the country's integrity. ''They could move in at any time. They don't recognize the sovereignty of our people,''  Kabila said at rebel headquarters in eastern Zaire. ''For us, it is a threat to our territorial integrity,''  said Kabila, whose campaign to oust President Mobutu Sese Seko has won control of the eastern third of Zaire since September. He said there should be no international intervention in Zaire. U.S., Belgian, French and British forces have arrived in Brazzaville, Congo, across the Zaire River from the Zairian capital of Kinshasa, in case Western civilians need to be evacuated from Zaire, should things turn bad in the capital. The rebels are not convinced that the evacuation of civilians is the goal of the foreign troops and the U.S. warship Nassau, which is standing off the coast of the central African nation. While delegations from Mobutu's government and the rebels met in South Africa to try to sort out a peaceful resolution to Zaire's crisis, the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire carried on its fight. The rebels are reported nearing Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city and the capital of the mineral-rich Shaba region. Kabila confirmed Sunday that the rebels had taken Mbuji-Mayi, the country's diamond-mining center, 700 kilometers (435 miles) northwest of Lubumbashi. When rebels approach a town, Mobutu's poorly paid and ill-disciplined troops usually loot the town they are assigned to guard then flee into the forest. This time Kabila said, ''We did meet some opposition before entering Mbuji-Mayi, but the presidential guards have handed over their weapons.''  The diamonds, and Shaba's copper and cobalt, have been a money-making machine for Mobutu's 31-year regime. And they will be a source of revenue for the alliance. ''We shall use the diamonds as a resource for our people,''  Kabila said. He said officials of the South-African-based Anglo American Corp. of South Africa, Ltd., which owns the diamond mines, were in Goma on Saturday to discuss plans and renegotiate contracts. Kabila said he envisions a transitional government, a political reorganization, then elections within a year. ''Twelve months is enough,''  he said. Last month, after the rebels took Kisangani, Kabila said only his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire would be allowed to function as a political party. But on Sunday, he said parties would be allowed to return to the political arena, including Mobutu's Popular Revolutionary Movement party, known as MPR, if necessary. But he insisted once again that the rebels would not share power with ''Mobutists.''  ''As soon as Mr. Mobutu says he is ready to hand over power to the alliance, and the transition is done in the way we envision and nothing is put in the hands of MPR, then everything else is possible,''  he said. The rebels could work with Etienne Tshisekedi, Zaire's new prime minister, he said. ''It is not individuals who interest us. We are ready to work with anyone,''  as long as they are not ''Mobutists,''  he said. ''The aim of the negotiations is for Mobutu to relinquish power. Power-sharing is not an issue. We do not accept it.''  The rebel alliance, which controls the important river port of Kisangani in central Zaire, agreed Saturday to allow international aid agencies to airlift Rwandan Hutu refugees from camps south of the city back to Rwanda. Relief agencies estimate that 120 of the estimated 100,000 refugees there are dying each day from malnutrition, disease and exhaustion. Sunday is the third anniversary of the beginning of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda that sparked the refugee exodus. More than 1 million Rwandan Hutus fled to Zaire in fear of retribution for the Hutu-government-orchestrated slaying of half a million minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus. More than 600,000 refugees returned home from Zaire in November when the rebellion in the east drove out the Hutu militants who had controlled the refugees in the camps. The 100,000 refugees near Kisangani were driven into the interior by militant Hutus running from the Zairian rebels they were fighting. Among them, the rebels say, are some of the hard-core Hutus responsible for the 1994 massacre. But there are also many thousands of others who are seriously ill. It was not immediately known when the airlift would begin. The logistical difficulties of moving such large numbers of people in a region with bad to non-existent roads are immense.","""1997-04-06T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-56N0-00BT-M4V3-00000-00"""

Regarding the head of state's activities, on 23rd March the president of the republic received South African Vice-President Thabo Mbeki to whom he confirmed his desire to prepare actively for peace negotiations among the countries of the Great Lakes region, and work for an end to the war in Zaire. On 24th March, the president of the republic received in turn the bureau of the High Councillors of the Republic - Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] led by Boboliko Lokonga, and at 1800 [local time] Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo. Today, the president of the republic received Congolese Prime Minister Charles Ganao. Regarding the decision by the HCR-PT, the president of the republic took concrete note of it. Here are the head of state's answers and initiative: Regarding an end to hostilities and the opening of negotiations, the president of the republic suggested to the HCR-PT the setting up of two bodies: a national council that will hold consultations, make reflections and take actions during the entire war period with the mission to mobilize all active forces of the nation for a national consensus on the need to settle peacefully all the differences facing the nation, to seek the ways and means of putting an end to the war in the east of the country so as to safeguard territorial integrity and the unity of the country. It must also enable us to adopt a national consensus on conditions that will enable the country to pursue the ongoing democratic process. Second organ: a committee of negotiators comprising seven members, namely a delegate from the president of the republic, two delegates from the HCR-PT, one delegate from the transitional government, one delegate from the courts and tribunals, and two delegates from the political groups. Concerning the government, the president of the republic took note of the dismissal decision made by the HCR-PT against the present government. He received Prime Minister Kengo, who submitted his resignation letter to him. The president of the republic, who could not judge either the timeliness or the legality of a decision made by an autonomous institution, took note of Prime Minister Kengo's resignation and, therefore, of his cabinet. He asked Prime Minister Kengo to take care of current affairs pending the naming of another government. In the same vein, the president of the republic has asked the political class, through the HCR-PT executive committee, to propose very quickly to him a new prime minister. The president of the republic holds to witness the national and international opinion to call on the Zairean political class to work with patriotism and a great sense of duty to the state to select the right man at the right place so as to help the country to overcome the crisis quickly. Concerning the Lome summit, the president of the republic charged Andre Bo Boliko Lokonga, first deputy prime minister, to represent him and to lead in his name the delegation that will represent Zaire at this important session.

./samples/,"A day after seizing power, Zaire's new President, Laurent Kabila, remained closeted today in this sun-washed and quiet southern town with his closest advisers, struggling to transform his seven-month-old rebel movement into a transitional government. It is a tall order. Now that rebel troops have taken the capital and former President Mobutu Sese Seko has fled, Mr. Kabila has enormous obstacles to overcome in forming a government from his relatively inexperienced group of aides. Without Mr. Mobutu's presence to galvanize the rebel alliance, internal divisions that have been simmering for months are likely to surface. Mr. Kabila's cabinet is a small clique of a dozen childhood friends, academics, professional revolutionaries and former exiles with little or no experience in running a country. So far, Mr. Kabila and his top officials have laid out their plans in broad strokes, saying they want to develop the country and eventually establish a multiparty democracy and a free-market economy. But they have yet to spell out in detail how they intend to do that or where they will find the expertise to manage this nation of 40 million people from hundreds of ethnic groups. The vagueness of Mr. Kabila's plans stem partly from the lightning speed of the recent rebel advance. ""The military guys were light years ahead of the political movement,"" a diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""For the most part, if you pose hard questions to the ministers, they will say, if they are being frank, 'We know these are important questions but our revolution moved so fast we haven't had time to work them out yet.' "" One large problem for Mr. Kabila is the paucity of managers in his inner circle. Some diplomats say they believe that Mr. Kabila will be forced to bring in other opposition leaders and outsiders just to fill the top government posts. In some cases, he might have to reach into the ranks of civil servants to find a manager. He has already done so with the giant state-owned mining company here, Gecamines, sacking the former manager, who had close ties to Mr. Mobutu, and appointing a popular middle manager to head the company. One mystery is who will become the Minister of Defense. The rebel alliance has maintained strict secrecy about their military commanders, refusing to give their names or to allow them to be interviewed by journalists. Soldiers of all ranks are under orders not to talk to the press. Even some of the civilian officials in the rebel alliance acknowledge that they do not know who the top military commanders are. Among the alliance's top civilian officials, some were Zairian exiles who showed up and offered their services to Mr. Kabila in early January. For instance, the Justice Minister, Mwenze Kongolo, was an investigator in the Philadelphia District Attorney's office who volunteered to help. The Finance Minister, Mwana Mawampanga, was an adjunct professor of agricultural economics at the University of Kentucky. Other members of the alliance are Zairian Tutsi who joined the rebellion early on. Among them is the Foreign Minister, Bizima Karaha, a 29-year-old pediatrician from South Africa who went to college here in Lubumbashi. His old college classmate Moise Nyarugabo, a lawyer, is Mr. Kabila's chief of staff. Mr. Kabila has several people holding jobs for which they have little or no training. The current Minister of Mines, for instance, Kambale Kabila Mututulo, has no experience in mining. He ran an English school and a charity in the northern Kivu Province. After Mr. Kabila, the most powerful political official in the rebel movement is Deogratius Bugera, an architect from Goma who heads a party representing Zairian Tutsi. There is little doubt most of those people will play some role in the new government, but it remains to be seen who else Mr. Kabila will draft. These days there is a steady stream of opposition politicians and former exiles coming through Lubumbashi, jockeying for position and offering to take part in the new government. In the meantime, Mr. Kabila will have to heal several internal divisions among his aides. There are tensions between people who have been living abroad and those who remained in Zaire during the Mobutu years. There is also friction between Tutsi officials and officials from other tribes, especially those who are Luba--Mr. Kabila's ethnic group. But perhaps most troubling for Mr. Kabila are the splits emerging in the military ranks. In the eastern provinces, there have been skirmishes reported between the Tutsi soldiers, who made up the rebels' fighting corps, and recruits from other ethnic groups.","""1997-05-19T00:00:00Z""","""3SP8-7DX0-000P-N2PX-00000-00"""

./samples/,"With President Mobutu Sese Seko out of the country, rebels pushed on toward the capital in what could be their final offensive to overthrow his 32-year rule. Heavy fighting was reported in Kenge, 120 miles east of the capital, and aid agencies said today that hundreds of people had been killed, including as many as 200 civilians. The rebels claimed that Mobutu had enlisted mercenaries from Rwanda, Angola and France to help stave off their final advance in the civil war that began in September. The government denied the charge. Following a failed summit with rebel leader Laurent Kabila, Mobutu flew off Wednesday to Libreville, Gabon, for meetings with other African presidents. His aides insisted the trip was planned long ago, but many saw it as a way to gracefully get the ailing 66-year-old dictator out of Zaire before Kabila's forces reached the capital. Today, wearing his trademark leopard skin cap, Mobutu walked hand-in-hand with President Omar Bongo of Gabon down a red carpet leading to the presidential palace in Libreville. Other leaders at today's talks included the presidents of Congo, Chad, the Central African Republic and Equatorial Guinea. Meanwhile, Mobutu's information minister said some foreign journalists will be expelled from Zaire for reporting that Mobutu was heading into exile. ""There is a true infiltration of journalists belonging to the enemy camp,"" said Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba. He also blamed media reports of rebel advances for the decision by some international airlines to stop flying into the capital. Air France and Swissair have diverted some of their Kinshasa-bound flights. U.S. envoy Bill Richardson was in Paris today to discuss the U.S. approach to peace in Zaire. France was among countries that for decades helped prop up Mobutu. Richardson said negotiators were pushing for a peaceful transition of power, and that there was reason to hope Mobutu would meet again with Kabila. ""America's long-standing goal has been a negotiated settlement that should lead to an inclusive transitional government, and fair and free elections"" in Zaire, he said. Richardson added he has pressed Kabila for full access for aid organizations to help Rwandan refugees in Zaire, some of whom have been slaughtered or disappeared. A French foreign ministry spokesman, Jacques Rummelhardt, would not comment on whether the French and Americans had discussed Mobutu's possible return to his villa in southern France. Zairian rebels today continued the campaign that so far has gained them three-quarters of this central African country. Doctors Without Borders, quoting church officials in Kenge, said fighting there claimed 300 lives Wednesday. Locals were appealing for medical supplies to treat the wounded. The Red Cross said today the civilian deaths in Kenge numbered as high as 200 people, including some of their Zairian medical volunteers. Mwenze Kongolo, the justice minister in Kabila's movement, said 5,000 men from Angola's former rebel army were blocking the road to Kinshasa to assist Mobutu, who supported the guerrillas in their 20-year civil war against the Angolan government. Under Mobutu's dictatorship, Zaire has fallen into poverty and dilapidation despite being rich in diamonds, copper and other natural resources. The capital is now an extended slum of rundown shacks and broken streets swamped in sewage. In eastern Zaire, U.N. officials were organizing an airlift of ill and exhausted Rwandan refugees from squalid camps south of Kisangani. But it was a race against time, they said, as more than 60 refugees were dying there each day. The U.N. refugee agency hopes to airlift up to 80,000 Rwandan refugees, remnants of a Hutu exodus two years ago amid fears of reprisals at home following Hutu-led massacres of 500,000 Tutsis. Most of the refugees returned after Zaire's civil war broke out, but others have been scattered by the fighting. Hutu refugees say the Zairian rebels - many of them ethnic Tutsis - have attacked and killed them.","""1997-05-08T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-89C0-000Y-K43M-00000-00"""

./samples/,"As the only surgeon left in the Congo's main hospital in Leopoldville during the civil war of 1960, American missionary Bill Close was overwhelmed tending the wounds of battling African tribesmen, policemen and soldiers. Then he thought about seeking help from a young colonel named Joseph Mobutu (later to become Mobutu Sese Seko), who had seized power after the country he later renamed Zaire was granted independence from Belgium. Close, the father of actress Glenn Close, says he flagged down Mobutu's car in a paratrooper camp and asked him to do something to stop the violence. ''Yes, I think I can,''  Mobutu replied, before driving off. Thirty-five years later, during an interview at his home here in the high plains of Wyoming, Close recalled the start of their 16-year relationship. Mobutu began calling on Close to take care of family members. Close also attended Moise Tshombe and other political opponents of Mobutu in prison. Close attended official banquets, meeting Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie and Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, among other African leaders. He was at Mobutu's side on village visits, dispensing medicine, and listening to what the people said to their president. He also witnessed U.S. ambassadors dressing down Mobutu, and the Zairian leader's humorous imitations of the ambassadors as soon as they departed. As the country degenerated into chaos with the oil embargo of 1973 and declining copper and cobalt prices, exacerbated by Mobutu's disastrous nationalization, Close watched the president become a prisoner of his own machinations. Mobutu and Close clashed as it became more and more difficult to get the money the doctor needed for the staff and patients of the hospital, which had been renamed for Mobutu's late mother, Mama Yemo. When Close's wife Bettine became ill with hepatitis, he decided to leave in 1976. His eldest daughter, Tina, was living in Jackson, Wyoming, and the Closes bought a ranch above Big Piney to ''get off the world.''  Close was born to a well-to-do family in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1924. His lawyer father became the administrator of the American Hospital in Paris. He attended Harvard, was a U.S. Army troop carrier pilot in World War II and then studied medicine at Columbia University in New York. By the time he graduated in 1951, he and his wife had three young children. After completing his residency at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, he spent six years traveling the world for a missionary group called Moral Re-Armament. The group sent Close to the Congo to do missionary work shortly before the country gained its independence from Belgium. Within a week, the army had mutinied, and he couldn't leave. He offered his services at the hospital, and soon became its only surgeon when a Belgian colleague left. Mobutu awarded Close the country's top honor, the Order of the Leopard. He gave the doctor the use of an old C-45 transport plane that President Kennedy had donated to the country earlier. Close never had a contract with Mobutu or the government. As director of the hospital, and chief doctor to the army, he was provided living quarters. He also saw private patients, and lived on that revenue until the early 1970s. With growing family expenses they now had a third daughter, Jessie Close asked for a retainer and was given dlrs 40,000 a year. Close doesn't regret having worked for Mobutu, but, ''I left when it became impossible to continue working.''  The final straw came, he says, ''when I fired a Zairian doctor for gross corruption and Mobutu insisted I take him back for political reasons. I refused.''  Close came to Wyoming and set up a small clinic in Big Piney. In 1987, he began renewing his contacts in Zaire to research a book, and possibly a movie on the 1976 outbreak of the Ebola virus. Daughter Glenn traveled with him to Zaire to visit the Yambuku Catholic Mission where the epidemic first hit. When riots erupted in September 1991, Close used his contacts to develop a private newsletter on events in Zaire. He downloaded computer reports from news agencies in a basement office of his Sandhill home outside Big Piney. Reporters in Zaire often found the Sandhill report more accurate than U.S. Embassy assessments. Close also began lobbying the State Department and influential congressmen to try to persuade Mobutu to hand over power, and he spoke out against the mismanagement and excesses that had impoverished the population. ''The iron fists of President Mobutu's special troops continue to repress and terrorize the people,''  Close said in an appearance before the Senate subcommittee on African Affairs in 1992. Mobutu has retained the presidency and control of the military, but has been forced to concede some power to a transitional government. That government invited Close to return to Zaire last year to work on projects aimed at restoring some basic medical services. Close saw Mobutu for the first time in 18 years. ''We spent an hour together. Basically we talked about the situation of his people,''  Close said. Close also remembers being ''moved to tears''  by the sight of hospital staff trudging three to four hours daily to work even though most of their patients had left because the hospital had nothing to offer them. Glenn Close, asked to describe her father, said he is ''a complex, enthusiastic, committed and meticulous humanitarian.''  She once gave him a T-shirt that says: ''I'm not obsessive! I'm not obsessive! I'm not obsessive!''  In the past six years Close has been writing about his experiences. A historical novel, ''Ebola,''  was recently published and is on some best-seller lists. He is talking with publishers about republishing ''The Earth Is Not A Resting Place,''  a collection of stories about practicing medicine from New York to Zaire to Wyoming. He is working on a new novel, and may be irresistibly drawn to writing about the Congo turmoil.","""1995-08-31T00:00:00Z""","""3SJD-VFB0-0070-13SV-00000-00"""

./samples/,"Burundi's military ruler, Maj. Pierre Buyoya, was sworn-in as president Friday in an apparent attempt to legitimize his assent to power following a July 25 coup. At a campus ceremony at the University of Burundi, members of Burundi's supreme court gave Buyoya the oath of office. Diplomats and U.N. officials attended the ceremony under tight security along with hundreds of Burundians. ''My government is a transitional government with a peace project. I want to talk to the rebels, if they agree to stop fighting,''  said Buyoya in his inaugural address. ''If they do not want to talk to me, I am determined to fight them and I am sure I will defeat them.''  He asked the international community to lift crippling sanctions imposed by 8 African countries following the bloodless coup. Burundi, landlocked on Lake Tanganyika in central Africa, depends entirely on imported fuel, now in short supply. The leaders of Tanzania, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire and Zambia cut all trade and transportation links with Burundi Aug. 9 until Buyoya restores a constitutional government and begins talks with Hutu rebels fighting the Tutsi-dominated army for control of the country. The sanctions have been taking a toll on the government, as well. Prime Minister Firmin-Pascal Ndimira on Thursday dismissed a large number of government employees because, saying sanctions made operating the industries impossible. Workers for the Burundian Transport Organization, a government-operated transportation supplier, said they would launch demonstrations next week if the government did not return them to the payroll. Even though Buyoya has restored the National Assembly and legalized political parties, an intergovernmental committee to review the sanctions, which met Wednesday in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, recommended that sanctions remain in place until talks begin with rebel groups. Burundi has a population of 5.6 million, with 85 percent Hutu, 14 percent Tutsi and 1 percent Twa. Tutsis have held power in Burundi since independence in 1961, though democratic elections organized by Buyoya in 1993 were supposed to begin power sharing. The elections brought Burundi's first democratically-elected president to power, but the Hutu leader was assassinated by Tutsi paratroopers four months later, setting off three year of ethnic violence that has claimed more than 150,000 lives.

./samples/,"Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila declared himself head of state of Zaire Saturday and added that the country would henceforth be called Democratic Republic of Congo. Soon after, the acting prime minister in Kinshasa told government forces to return to their barracks and wait. The order from General Likulia Bolongo was relayed by the government radio service Voice of Zaire, which resumed broadcasting after an unexplained break lasting several hours. The vanguard of the rebels reached downtown Kinshasa Saturday morning, a day after President Mobutu Sese Seko fled, eyewitnesses said by telephone. Mobutu's son, Captain Mobutu Kongolu, arrived with his family by boat in Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo. Eyewitnesses said machine-gun fire was audible in Kinshasa, population five million, but it was not clear if the shooting was from fighting between rebels and soldiers, or whether it was just shooting in the air, possibly by security forces to deter looters. Kabila told a news conference at rebel headquarters in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi he was taking over with the approval of Zaire's armed forces commanders and the movement he leads, the ADFL, was in full control of the country as of Saturday. Kabila added that he would set up a ""government of national salvation"" within 72 hours and declared Zaire's interim constitution was no longer in force. He said a constitutional assemby would be summoned within three months to draft a new constitution. The rebel leader, who began his career as a Marxist opponent of Mobutu's in the 1960s, called on the Kinshasa-controlled armed forces to lay down its arms and he appealed to residents of Kinshasa to keep calm. All settlings of accounts would be punished later, he warned. The new government would abide by its ""international obligations"", he added. Kabila said the country would no longer be called Zaire, its name since 1971. A reversion to the name Congo gives the country its title from the colonial era, when it was called the Belgian Congo, but also encourages confusion with its neighbour Congo, once the French Congo. Both states are named after the 4,820-kilometre-long Congo River, which was named after the Kongo ethnic group that lives near it. Amid the turmoil in the capital it was difficult to tell who armed men on the move in the city were. French correspondents said the rebels had reached the river port area, but other reporters in the Kinshasa city centre said they had still seen no sign of the rebels. A reporter speaking to the U.S. television channel CNN said by late morning there had been demonstrations but no appearance of rebels. A German businessman in the city said by phone he thought the rebels had not yet advanced past the airport. Large numbers of soldiers appeared to be deserting, getting rid of their uniforms and putting on civilian dress, eyewitnesses added. Many of the deserters were taking their assault rifles with them. The German businessman said by telephone that looting by indisciplined soldiers had broken out. City residents have long been worried that armed ex-soldiers will help themselves to property in the hours or days before rebels establish control, or that people will kill one another during the interregnum on account of grudges. ""You can hear shooting from automatic weapons all round the city,"" said the businessman. ""I'm lying down on the floor for safety. The Americans have got 1,000 men on the other side of the river, but don't come and save us,"" he added bitterly, referring to U.S. forces in nearby Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo. Asked who was doing the looting, he said: ""It's the DSP (the presidential guard) plundering the place."" Earlier Saturday the rebel alliance ADFL took control of Kinshasa international airport. An ADFL spokesman said that the airport, at N'djili, some 20 kilometres from Kinshasa, was captured without a fight after government forces withdrew. Mobutu Kongolu, the son of the former president, told his troops before he fled to Brazzaville that they should not shoot at the rebels. There was no immediate confirmation of reports that factional fighting had broken out within the presidential guard between fight- to-the-death loyalists and elements willing to capitulate to the ADFL. Eyewitnesses said there was some shooting in the area of the Tshatshi base, a presidential guard barrack in Kinshasa. The guard is a fighting force separate from the army and designed to keep the army in check. Diplomats said they hoped the rebels would be able to take control without a fight. They said there was no plan to evacuate foreigners at the moment, because Kinshasa was tense and the risks incalculable. The rebels urged government forces not to put up any resistance and to display a white flag to signal their readiness to surrender. During the night the head of the Zairean armed forces was assassinated, apparently by Mobutu loyalists in the presidential guard. Broadcast reports said that the armed forces chief of staff and minister of defence, Mahele Lieko Bokungu, was killed by troops who stormed his office on a base near Kinshasa airport. The troops reportedly felt he had betrayed the army and had collaborated with the rebels. Mobutu fled the capital Friday and took up residence at his palace in the northern city of Gbadolite. He was expected to take up exile in Morocco or France in the coming days. South Africa was to send a top-level delegation Sunday to Kabila to press him to accept other parties into his transitional government, the South African news agency SAPA reported. The panel would probably be led by Vice-President Thabo Mbeki, who spoke with Kabila on Saturday by telephone, the agency said. A government official said there was concern that one dictatorship in Zaire could give way to another. Kabila's fashion of declaring himself head of state was more or less a coup. South Africa earlier drafted a peace plan proposing a multi-party interim government. Germany called for an end to fighting in Zaire. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said both sides had to ensure the security of German nationals and other foreigners in Zaire. He said the country needed to make a fresh democratic start, crowned by free elections. dpa jbp ms","""1997-05-17T00:00:00Z""","""3RPR-R3R0-0094-N1TX-00000-00"""

A3 2d Arab Land Dealer KilledA Palestinian accused of selling land to Israelis was found slain in the West Bank. It was the second such killing since the Palestinian Authority announced this month that it would impose a death sentence on Arabs who sold land to Jews. The victim, a building contractor identified as Harbi Abu Sara, 60, was found in the Palestinian-ruled town of Ramallah and had been shot in the head. Palestinian security officials denied any involvement. A3 Canadians Debate UnityLeaders of Canada's five main political parties held a third television debate before national parliamentary elections on June 2. The most emotional issue debated was Quebec separation. But a poll published in the Toronto Star said 40 percent of the respondents identified Canada's 9.6 percent unemployment rate as the country's biggest problem and only 6 percent cited national unity. A8 Mongolia Votes for PresidentNomads stood in line with Buddhist monks, soldiers, and men and women in suits and dresses to vote in a presidential election in Mongolia that will determine the pace of the country's move toward capitalism. No official tally was issued, but turnout appeared to be high. It was the fourth multiparty election since 1990, when the Soviet-backed Government abandoned Communism.

A1Companies Court GraduatesColleges and universities are reporting record numbers of recruiters on campus, often offering more jobs than they can fill. The booming job market seems to be a product of the soaring economy and of companies' efforts to strengthen staffs weakened by large-scale layoffs. Many experts say companies laid off too many employees in the early 90's and need more workers now that business has picked up. A1Minority Gains SlowingThe gain in minority college enrollment for 1995 was more subdued than in earlier years, according to a report to be released today by the American Council on Education. The study found a 2.9 percent increase in overall minority enrollment in 1995, the most recent year for which data were available. In 1994, the gain was 4.6 percent; in 1993, it was 7.1 percent.

B8Puerto Rican Teachers ProtestTeachers in Puerto Rico are objecting to a plan to begin using English as a second language of instruction in public schools, even though English is routinely spoken in government and business. The teachers call the plan a political rather than pedagogic move by a pro-statehood government that wants to make the island more palatable to Congress. A12 Boon for Solar PowerA California electric utility has signed a big contract to buy solar cells, and the utility and the Department of Energy say the move will push the cells' cost down to a competitive level by 2002. Experts say it is the largest utility purchase of solar cells, which make electricity from sunlight. The utility, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, will buy 10 megawatts of solar cells by 2002, enough to supply hundreds of houses.

./samples/,"With Zaire spiraling into turmoil, the White House today increased pressure on President Mobutu Sese Seko to leave office. ""Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history,"" a spokesman said. White House press secretary Mike McCurry delivered an unusually blunt message to reporters as Mobutu fired his prime minister, Etienne Tshisekedi, and named the army chief of staff head of government. Mobutu took the action after soldiers seized longtime rival Tshisekedi, who was trying to move into his new office. Rebels are trying to end Mobutu's 32-year dictatorship. ""We've been pressing for a negotiated solution to the ongoing conflict between the government and the rebel faction for some time,"" McCurry said. ""We welcome reports of some progress on the U.N.-sponsored talks that have been occurring in South Africa."" ""Meanwhile, we have said that we recognize that a negotiated solution will have to...include agreements on interim transitional government arrangements, leading ultimately to elections. That clearly reflects our view that Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history,"" McCurry said. Afterward, aides pointed out that McCurry stopped short of flatly demanding that Mobutu resign or go into exile. They said the United States wants Mobuto to be a part of a peaceful transition to democracy, even though the administration does not expect him to survive the change politically. Mtumbabo Clement, a senior aide to Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, who was fired by Mobutu, praised the U.S. position. ""The U.S. administration has finally come to see that the post-Mobutu era has arrived. I hope France also gets the same message,"" he said. McCurry said the United States conveyed the message to Mobutu through diplomatic channels ""because the support for President Mobutu is not sufficient to lead Zaire."" He would not comment on whether the United States was trying to arrange the president's exile. An administration official said it would be a ""logical leap"" to assume that Mobuto would eventually go into exile after his tenure runs its course. But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration thinks that decision is up to Mobuto and the people of Zaire. Meanwhile, congressional critics of U.S. policy on Zaire are expressing concern about the political ambitions of the rebel leader who is trying to drive Mobutu from power. Laurent Kabila has said he does not seek the presidency and wants to see a transition government and free elections. But he also has said he would not welcome outside observers or other political parties. ""I'm not very clear as to the democratic intentions of Mr. Kabila,"" Rep. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, senior Democratic on the House International Relations subcommittee on Africa, said Tuesday. However, committee members were unanimous in saying the United States should play a more aggressive role in helping Zaire end Mobutu's rule. ""What is clear is that Mobutu has no legitimate role in a new Zaire government,"" said Rep. Edward Royce, R-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee. ""At most, he can help to bring about its creation, primarily through his departure....The era of the 'big man' seems to be waning."" Royce added that ""it seems the United States has been standing by doing nothing,"" while Kabila overtakes Zaire and an ailing Mobutu, who has prostate cancer and has spent much of the past few years in France. The Washington Post reported today that the Clinton administration had conveyed to Mobutu through various African leaders its belief that he should resign and go into exile. Quoting a source close to the Mobutu family, the newspaper said the U.S. message had been conveyed to Mobutu by King Hassan of Morocco, Gabon President Omar Bongo and other intermediaries. Kabila's forces control the eastern third of Zaire. George Moose, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said Kabila has told U.S. officials the rebel alliance wants democracy. ""Obviously, we need to see not just the words, but the deeds,"" he said. As for possible rebel massacres of Zairian citizens and Rwandan refugees, who have been caught in the conflict, Moose said a U.N. observer last month visited alleged mass grave sites and is probing further.

./samples/,"An African summit on the crisis in Zaire opened Wednesday, with leaders from around the continent urging the government and rebels to find a way to peace. More than 15 African heads of state and other representatives attended the summit held in Lome, Togo, under the aegis of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Also present was U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who comes from Ghana. Neither Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko, nor rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila personally attended the summit, though each sent representatives. African foreign ministers who met one day ahead of the summit drew up a draft resolution on the Zairean crisis. Diplomats say it is similar to the U.N.'s five-point peace plan, but that it solves the rebel-government controversy over which comes first - talks or a truce? - by calling for negotiations and a ceasefire at the same time. But as the summit opened, both sides seemed as far apart as ever, with the rebels rejecting a recent offer by Zaire's embattled government to join a power-sharing deal. Mobutu's ruling Popular Revolutionary Movement party has said it would be willing to share power with the rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), who have now seized nearly one-quarter of Zaire. The ruling party said a transitional government could be formed which would prepare the country for eventual elections. But the rebels have adamantly rejected such a plan. They say Mobutu's fraying government is corrupt, and that the rebels have been fighting for freedom, democracy and a united country, not for ""power sharing"" with a regime they view as rotten. ""We shall never, never enter into any power sharing with the government in Kinshasa,"" rebel foreign policy adviser Bizima Karaha, in Lome for the summit, told the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio Wednesday. ""One thing is for sure, we won't let them continue with those games,"" Karaha added. The resignation Monday night of prime minister Kengo wa Dondo has also failed to impress the rebels, who say it does not change the way they view the government. But Kengo's resignation has set off a heated beauty contest among several Zairean opposition leaders who want his old post - most prominent among them is long-time Mobutu foe Etienne Tshisekedi. Mobutu's spokesman says the ailing president wants to appoint a seven-member negotiating team to begin talks with Kabila's rebels. He told Zaire's state television that Mobutu would also create a national council to advise on the transition to democracy. But Kabila seems unwilling to embrace any quick deal with Mobutu, since he is in a position of strength. His forces have now come within 100 kilometres of Lubumbashi, Zaire's second largest city and the capital of mineral-rich Shaba province, after capturing strategic Kisangani earlier this month. The rebels are refusing to let tens of thousands of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi enter Kisangani, said Paul Stromberg, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in eastern Zaire. The large group of refugees already on the road will be turned back to Ubundu camp, some 120 kilometres to the southeast, the UNHCR official said. Aid agencies have been sending food and other supplies to Ubundu, where many of the refugees caught in the war zone have massed. With the fall of Kisangani many of the armed militiamen among the refugees have fled further west, leaving the civilian refugees free to eventually return home with assistance from the UNHCR, Stromberg said. dpa slg ms","""1997-03-26T00:00:00Z""","""3RPR-RD00-0094-N1CH-00000-00"""
./samples/,"From AP-Reuters-CP KINSHASA, Zaire (CP) - Zaire's rebels marched into the capital virtually unopposed Saturday and their leader Laurent Kabila, victorious after seven months of civil war, proclaimed himself head of state. As jubilant crowds greeted the rebels after their marathon march across Africa's third largest country, ousted president Mobutu Sese Seko's rag-tag army switched sides, ditched their uniforms or fled. Mobutu, 66, who is dying of prostate cancer, yielded power Friday and left the capital for his ancestral home in the north. He is said to be going to Morocco and from there possibly to France to live in exile. Kabila, 56, renamed Zaire the Democratic Republic of Congo, reverting to the title used after independence from Belgium in 1960 and before Mobutu renamed the sprawling, mineral-rich country in 1971. ""I am happy, very happy to succeed,''  Kabila beamed at rebel headquarters in the southeastern mining town of Lubumbashi. Brimming with confidence, Kabila announced a nine-point ""power-taking declaration''  that named him as president. ""Laurent Desire Kabila assumes from today the functions of head of state,''  he said, reading a statement from his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo. Rebel leaders made the decision Friday, he said, to avoid a power vacuum that could bring conflict and bloodshed. Kabila, who has fought to oust Mobutu for 32 years, said he would form ""a transitional government of national salvation''  within three days, and would convene an assembly within 60 days to write a new constitution. He did not mention elections, which he previously has promised within a year of taking power. Kabila said he talked by telephone with Mobutu's generals, and ""everyone was ready to receive orders from me, it is clear.''  Senior officials of Mobutu's government were advised to continue in their posts. But many, including Prime Minister Gen. Likulia Bolongo, fled. Kabila's forces swiftly captured Kinshasa as they did the rest of the country in the past eight months - with little resistance. Some of Mobutu's soldiers heeded orders to surrender arms to the rebels. Some generals and politicians fled across the Zaire River to Brazzaville, Congo. The new leader was expected to arrive in the capital from his southern headquarters at Lubumbashi in the next few days, rebel sources said. ""The war is over,''  said Bizima Karaha, rebel foreign minister. ""It is the end of one of the worst dictatorships that humanity has ever experienced. ""The issue now is how to reconstruct our country, how to build a democracy, and a better life for all of our country.''  Among Kabila's challenges will be convincing the country's 40 million people and more than 250 tribes, among Africa's most ethnically and politically fractious, that the alliance is a nationwide movement. Rebels entered the radio station in Kinshasa unopposed, and in their first radio broadcast, ordered defeated government troops to report by this morning and warned looters they would be severely punished. Witnesses in the wealthy Binza district had reported looting by residents from a neighboring shantytown before the rebels arrived. Earlier, sporadic shooting rang out in parts of the city of five million, but France, one of five Western countries with troops across the river in Congo, said there were no plans to evacuate foreign nationals. There are about 400 Canadians in Zaire. Kabila urged calm in Kinshasa, and warned that anyone who harms Zairians or foreigners would be dealt with severely. The main rebel force was setting up camp at the football stadium, where about 1,000 men had assembled by late afternoon. The United States welcomed the relatively smooth transfer of power and called on the new leadership to establish an inclusive transitional government leading to elections. France, which for decades propped up Mobutu's regime, expressed displeasure that a negotiated solution hadn't been reached. Earlier, a diplomat said presidential guards from Mobutu's Nbgandi tribe killed defence minister and army chief of staff Gen. Mahele Lieko Bokungo on Friday night. Diplomats said Mahele had been planning to meet Kabila to discuss handing over power. Kabila and his rebels took up arms in October in a dispute over Zairian nationality for ethnic Tutsis. The rebel leader said he was unconcerned about Mobutu's future. ""He can stay in his village, but I think it is not very important at all,''  he said. Mobutu, with whom France had a close relationship for decades, has a villa on the French Riviera, but it was not clear if he would go to France to live in exile. Diplomats in Rabat, Morocco, where Mobutu also has a lavish home, have said they expect him to arrive there soon. Mobutu was expected in Morocco on Saturday night, and then would travel to Lichtenstein several hours later, a Moroccan government official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mobutu would stay in Lichtenstein until after the French legislative elections, at which point he would settle into exile in France. Asked Friday whether France would receive Mobutu, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt would say only: ""It is speculation since we don't know the intentions of Mr. Mobutu.''  Switzerland moved to block all assets Mobutu holds there. He is reputed to have amassed a huge personal fortune over the years. For years, Western powers supported Mobutu as a Cold War bastion against Soviet communism.","""1997-05-17T00:00:00Z""","""4706-3630-01G6-81G3-00000-00"""
./samples/,"A planned meeting between ailing Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila on board a South African navy vessel collapsed on Friday, South African radio reported. Kabila refused to meet with Mobutu, the radio said without giving further details. Mobutu and South African President Nelson Mandela earlier went aboard the ship in the Congolese port of Pointe Noire. Kabila was originally scheduled to fly to the ship by helicopter from the Angolan capital of Luanda with South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. Earlier Mobutu's ill health caused almost five hours of delay because he could not climb the 31 metal steps to get aboard the SAS Outeniqua in Pointe-Noire, officials said. The problem was finally solved by lowering a make-shift gateway over which he was driven by car on board the vessel. According to Zaire's Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda doctors had advised the cancer-stricken Mobutu against travelling by helicopter as originally planned because the vibrations would be bad for him. Mandela had earlier expressed optimism that the talks would take place. ""I am confident the two leaders realise the importance of a peaceful settlement,"" he said adding: ""I know few leaders who have made military gains and nevertheless been committed to peace as Mr Kabila has."" United States special envoy Bill Richardson echoed Mandela's optimism adding he hoped the meeting would lead to a transfer of power and, hopefully, an inclusive transitional government. The United Nations and Organisation of African Unity special envoy for the Great Lakes region, Mohamed Sahnoun, who with South Africa played a central role in brokering the meeting, was also due to take part in the talks as well as South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo. During talks with Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe in Harare on Thursday, Kabila vowed to continue his alliance's march on the Zairean capital, Kinshasa. He would not change the stance on the aim of the talks. ""We have to discuss a peaceful transfer to power,"" he said. Rebel sources said Thursday that Mobutu was prepared to discuss conditions for his resignation. This would be the only issue at the meeting, Bizima Karaha - ""foreign minister"" of the ADFL rebel alliance - told a press conference in Lubumbashi. In Nairobi United Nations officials said an operation to airlift refugees from Kisangani in eastern Zaire to Rwanda was in full progress. Another 800 Hutu refugees were flown out on Friday, the spokesman of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Peter Kessler said. The ADFL was showing more cooperation after worldwide criticism when it prevented aid organisations from reaching the refugees. Kessler said the rebels were bringing the refugees to Kisangani with trains and that the ADFL had agreed to a U.N. request to establish another transit camp for 5,000 refugees in Kisangani. Aid workers discovered another group of between 15,000 and 20,000 refugees who fled a U.N. camp south of Kisangani last week. They belonged to a total of 85,000 people who fled the camps for the jungle fearing rebel attacks. dpa hs rg","""1997-05-02T00:00:00Z""","""3RPR-R6K0-0094-N4XB-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Zairean strongman Laurent Kabila, who has pledged to form a government of national salvation by Tuesday, says that governing this vast and despoliated central African country will be harder than waging war. Kabila, who declared himself president Saturday as his troops entered Kinshasa after a seven-month campaign which started in the east, told a press conference in this southern stronghold on May 5 that ""the hardest part is ahead--governing this destroyed country."" The post-war political objectives of the rebels were spelled out on May 11 by ""foreign minister"" Bizima Karaha. He said then that the alliance would institute a market economy, stabilise the country and the entire region, unite the nation, and bring democracy, prosperity and respect for human rights. rights. The war cost relatively few lives, with the disillusioned troops of president Mobutu Sese Seko fleeing before the rebels in most cases. Reliable sources said the few big battles were fought mainly by troops from other African countries fighting on the two sides. The rebel troops were welcomed everywhere by joyous civilians, but that reaction, despite the charisma of 56-year-old ""Papa"" Kabila, appears to have been essentially one of relief that the Mobutu years were coming to an end. Now, observers say, Kabila must win support from Zaire's myriad tribes and regions, and develop foreign and economic policies which will reassure the big powers and foreign investors. Kabila and his officials have promised elections in around two years, preceded by an assembly, to be convoked within two months, which will draft a new constitution for the country the rebels call the Democratic Republic of Congo. In the meantime, the rebels say, the transitional government will be open to opposition politicians--excluding those who supported Mobutu--but on an individual basis, with no participation by Zaire's more than 450 political parties. At this stage, they are refusing to name names, but talk to Kinshasa constantly on the cellular telephone network. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, one of Kabila's strongest supporters, held ""no-party"" elections last year in which all parliamentary and presidential candidates had to stand as individuals, but ""foreign minister"" Bizima Karaha said here Saturday that the rebels ""have our own model."" South Africa, which spearheaded efforts to get Kabila and Mobutu together to agree on a peaceful transition, is still trying to win assurances that the new government will be broad-based. Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was due to fly to Lubumbashi on Sunday afternoon to meet Kabila, Mbeki spokesman Ricky Naidoo said in Pretoria. He refused to go into detail, but South Africa's Sunday Independent newspaper quoted an unidentified official as saying that Mbeki would try to win guarantees from Kabila that he would rule Zaire democratically in exchange for early recognition from its powerful southern neighbour. ""Until we get those assurances, we cannot recognise him as head of state,"" the official said. The current rebel ""commissars general,"" as they are known in the language of the alliance, which sometimes reflects Kabila's Marxist past, lack political experience, but are loyalists. Karaha, the foreign minister, told journalists he was not even born when Mobutu seized power 32 years ago, and he has spent most of his adult life as a medical student. The ""minister of mines,"" Florent Kambale Kabila Mututulo, was an English teacher a few months ago, and went down his first mine on May 10 with a delegation of international investment bankers. Diplomats and businessmen here say that the addition of experienced Kinshasa politicians would increase the rebels' ability to deal effectively with the outside world and with Zaire's different political tendencies once the bloom of victory has faded, but that it would increase in-fighting around the cabinet table. An official of America Mineral Fields, which organised the bankers' visit, told AFP that the US mining company regarded loyalty among Kabila's aides as more important than experience as he prepared the assault on Kinshasa. The alliance now needs to mend fences, diplomats say. Western support for Kabila, lukewarm from the start, plummeted after allegations that his troops were killing Rwandan Hutu refugees. His ""commissars"" responded by charging that UN Secretary General Kofi Annan was repeating ""Mobutu propaganda,"" and that European Union Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs Emma Bonino was a ""psycopath."" hn/gd gd","""1997-05-18T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-34Y0-0025-F4SV-00000-00"""
./samples/,"YOUR Leader (Rejoicing in Kinshasa, May 19), is right in pointing out the role of the US Export-Import Bank in the destruction of Zaire. However, with the tyrannical Mobutu regime as history now, it is important for democratic forces to support the new government of Laurent Kabila and the Congolese people with moral, diplomatic and concrete assistance in rebuilding democratic and economic institutions that will make the new era meaningful in everyday life. President Kabila's transitional government has to bring in the Lumumbaists. As to the Zairean Tutsis, it is important to acknowledge their role in ending the 32 years of despotism. A policy that allows regional governments (Kisangani, Lumumbashi, Maji Mbuji, Bukava) to tackle the problems of bad governance, ethnicity, corruption and economic mismanagement associated with the past regime is a necessity. The new authorities should remember that only regional co-operation can lessen further insurgency in the region. A common citizenship for all people of the Great Lakes region, free movement of labour and capital and the retrieval of the millions stolen by Mobutu and his friends should be some of the polices that the leaders of Angola, Uganda, Rwanda and, of course, the Democratic Republic of the Congo need to think and act on.

It is indeed a pleasure to address your listeners from this beautiful city of Retalhuleu where we are overseeing security matters as in other departments of the republic. We have not been able to visit the highlands, which we wanted to do early, but we are on the south coast now.

We have been also in Mazatenango and we have seen that the elections are taking place normally, quietly, that the people are going to vote, but this is not my sphere of action. There is a bit less participation for this election than for the previous elections, but the people are voting.

./samples/,"Zairean rebels claimed Thursday that President Mobutu Sese Seko knows he will have to negotiate his ouster at his imminent meeting with rebel leader Laurent Kabila. Speaking in the rebel stronghold of Lubumbashi, Zaire's second city in the southeast, rebel negotiator Bizima Karaha said Marshal Mobutu ""knows very well that we are going to negotiate the way of his departure."" ""It is very important that he comes for that. It will help with other negotiating points,"" added Karaha, who is the foreign affairs spokesman in the Tutsi-dominated rebel alliance. alliance. ""We are ready to allow a time-frame for Mobutu's departure,"" Karaha said, adding that the alliance ""is delighted that Mobutu has for the first time decided to negotiate in person and seriously."" The South African president's office announced Thursday that Mobutu and Kabila will meet Friday for talks chaired by President Nelson Mandela on board a South African naval vessel. Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Mandela will leave Johannesburg on Friday morning for the Congolese port of Pointe-Noire, where he will meet Mobutu and Gabonese President Omar Bongo. All three leaders will then fly out to the supply ship Outeniqua off the coast by helicopter, Mankahlana added. South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was due to leave Thursday for the Angolan capital Luanda, where he will be joined by Kabila before flying out to the ship. Previously, the South Africans had said a meeting between Mobutu and Kabila would be postponed from Friday to Saturday, amid conflicting reports about a possible venue. Karaha added: ""We are not going to talk about a ceasefire. A ceasefire would mean that our people will lose much after its sacrifices. The liberation must not stop. ""We are very optimistic. The man who has corrupted, killed and brought poverty to this country has agreed to go,"" Karaha claimed, but he added that Mobutu ""could yet trick the international community"" by saying he is ready to meet Kabila and then failing to do so, as happened regarding previous talks mooted in South Africa. Mobutu had been due on Thursday to fly to the Gabonese capital, Libreville, but the trip was cancelled without any explanation. Libreville had been proposed as one possible venue for talks. Karaha added that the alliance would prefer talks to take place on Sunday, but ""can be flexible"" about the date. On the question of a transitional government which the United States has been pushing for, Karaha said Mobutu supporters could not take part. ""There will be a government and the alliance will not be greedy. The people will participate freely. But the 'Mobutists' should leave power to others, after 32 years,"" he said, adding that ""real elections"" will be held. A US special envoy, Bill Richardson, on Thursday held talks in Libreville with Bongo and was due to go on to Luanda later in the day. He said he would attend the first part of any talks between Kabila and Mobutu. The United States has been pushing to avoid a bloodbath in Kinshasa. The rebels have strengthened their hold around the capital by taking the town of Kikwit, 500 kilometres (300 miles) to the east, which is a strategic road junction and food supply route for the capital. Kabila himself said Thursday that his forces would continue to march on Kinshasa despite the planned meeting with Mobutu. He was speaking after talks in Harare with Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, who will take over as chairman of the Organisation of African Unity in June. Meanwhile Thursday, more than 10,000 workers, including airline staff, shoe-shiners, railway workers and market women, held a colourful march for three hours in Lubumbashi to celebrate the first ""May Day in Free Congo"".

./samples/,"By Jean-Luc Porte GOMA, Zaire, March 3 (AFP) - Zairean rebels poised to seize Kisangani, the last government stronghold in the east, on Monday said that President Mobutu Sese Seko must quit power before they stopped fighting. ""We demand direct negotiations with Mobutu to organise his departure in order to leave the management of the country to men of integrity,"" a rebel spokesman, Gilles Ingala Gwamona, said Monday in Goma. Marshal Mobutu is currently in Nice, southeastern France, following medical tests. One of his aides said he was not expected to return to his strife-torn country before next week. week. week. Gwamona, a member of a rebel delegation which took part in initial peace talks in South Africa last month, said ""any suspension of hostilities can only come"" once Mobutu, in power since 1965, has stood down. ""Those who want a ceasefire before talks have the sole aim of weakening the (rebel) Alliance,"" which began its insurrection last October and has seized control of a vast swathe of eastern Zaire, he said. At the weekend, rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila said his men were on the verge of taking Kisangani, having already overrun two more key towns - Lubutu and Kindu - and the last main camp for Rwandan Hutu refugees. Rebel advances have led thousands of refugees to flee. Kabila had warned of an assault against Tingi-Tingi where he charged that Rwandan former government troops and extremist Hutu militias were being armed by the Zairean army and intimidating and torturing refugees. A rebel foreign affairs official, Bizima Karaha, ruled out the idea of a national unity government and said: ""We are fighting for the liberation of our country, not to obtain jobs as some malicious people suggest."" He also appeared to exclude any partition of Zaire, but also said that retaining the territorial integrity of the country was ""not a problem for the Alliance unless as the Kinshasa regime remains in power"". The latest rebel gains were ""successes for a popular army which is fighting mercenaries"", Karaha added, stating that ""Mobutu is counting on two armies which carried out genocide in their own countries, Rwandan Hutus and Bosnian Serbs."" The government claims that the rebels are backed by Tutsi-led regimes in Rwanda and Burundi and by Uganda, which had been a home in exile for many of the Rwandan Tutsi rebel soldiers who seized power in Kigali after the 1994 genocide of more than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. All three neighbouring countries deny this. The rebels' 'justice minister', Kongolo Mwenze, on Monday denounced what he called ""manoeuvring on the question of Hutu refugees by some countries such as France and Belgium to put the Mobutu regime back in the saddle."" He appeared to be referring to renewed international calls for a foreign buffer force to go to Zaire to help refugees, which was last month mooted again by the Organisation of African Unity, France and senior UN officials. ""Everybody knew that Tingi-Tingi was a military camp as well as a refugee camp,"" Mwenze stressed. The coordinator for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the rebel-held eastern Kivu provinces, Filippo Grandi, said that evacuating some 160,000 refugees from the Tingi-Tingi region would be a ""nightmare in view of logistical difficulties"". But in Nairobi, a spokeswoman for the UN World Food Programme (WFP), Brenda Barton, said that the camps at Tingi-Tingi ""appeared empty"" when aid workers flew over the region on Sunday. Barton earlier said that about 10,000 people, apparently Rwandan and Burundian Hutus, had been spotted moving through forest towards Punia, 135 kilometres (85 miles) south of the Lubutu and Tingi-Tingi region. Punia is already home to 4,000 refugees. Truckers arriving in Kisangani, 250 kilometres (155 miles) north of the former camp, reported that thousands of refugees were on the road around Ubunda, 150 kilometres (95 miles) south of the threatened government stronghold. Kabila on Sunday indicated that thousands of refugees were moving back to Tingi-Tingi, called on the UNHCR to help them, and said that the rebels would set up safe corridors for them to go home to Rwanda. The UNHCR spokesman in Nairobi, Peter Kessler, on Monday gave a guarded welcome to this invitation. ""It could be good news, if we had security and if we could have mobility,"" he said, ""... but we cannot work in the middle of a war."" The main exiled Hutu organisation, the Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda (RDR), on Monday urged ""humanitarian organisations still faithful to their mission"" urgently to help some ""half a million refugees...cast into the forest, without assistance and under rebel guns."" RDR spokesman Chris Nzabandora accused aid workers of a ""shameful retreat"" in pulling out of the camp and also in withdrawing from Kisangani last week because of the rebel threat. luc-hn/nb/ns AFP Zambia will beef up its defences in the north of the country as refugees continue to flee the civil war in neighbouring Zaire, Finance Minister Ronald Penza said Monday. ""The situation is fluid, especially if we have a lot of people coming with arms. They can conquer our country,"" Penza told reporters at Mbala air force base about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north of the capital Lusaka. Zambia hosts some 6,000 Zairean refugees at Natende camp in the northern provincial capital of Kasama, most of them having arrived through Mpulungu port on Lake Tanganyika. The government is concerned with the possibility of increased insecurity in the area as a dozen Zairean soldiers were caught with guns as they arrived from the war-torn country three weeks ago. Sources at Mpulungu told AFP that there could be more guns hidden in the ships that brought the refugees, several of which are still docked at the harbour. Penza said after a visit to the area that more defence and security personnel would be deployed there. The refugee issue had to be tackled immediately, Penza said, adding that he would present an assessment of the financial impact of the influx to parliament. kc/lb/dw AFP afp afp","""1997-03-03T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-3PX0-0025-F3SB-00000-00"""
./samples/,"[10] Excerpts from speech by Vice-President Paul Kagame, broadcast by Rwandan radio on 4th July Excellencies the president of the republic, president of the National Assembly, prime minister, honourable members of parliament, guests and Rwandans: we are today commemorating two years since the formation of the Rwandan unity government following the genocide... But though many good things are being done and others will be done in the future, there are many people who are not happy about this. These are the ones who killed in this country and are now busy disturbing the peace in various parts of our country. I want to say that although we are on the right path and have made achievements and aim to move forward, we must find a solution to the problem. Finding a solution to the problem is not easy, but also not very difficult. We can search for an answer somewhere in the middle. Finding a solution needs all Rwandans to work positively for their country, to distance themselves from the evil practised by some Rwandans, and not just sit and watch but play an active role. The policies of those who took part in causing the country problems are not easily abandoned. This is why we are currently witnessing events in the Zairean areas of Masisi, Rutshuru phonetic and other places. Rwandan genocide perpetrators carried out their acts against Rwandans they found living in Zaire as Zaireans. This is a proof that evil deeds are part of their political thinking. This is not enough for them and they are still making plans to return to the country to disturb peace in Rwanda. As Rwandans who decided to fight the evil deeds, as we did earlier and still wish to do, we should focus our attention on this issue. I mean the issue of those who have recently been killed by Rwandans who had earlier killed people in this country. What I can say is that this should not deter us from our programme - though we must find a solution to the problem at all costs. We must find a remedy whatever its cost applause . It is important that everything legal be done to stop this. This will definitely cause ""casualties"" preceding word in English, injuries applause . There is no doubt about this and no one should fear this. It is unbelievable that some people should enter the country, select people and kill them: they kill survivors of earlier killings and continue doing so. The job of stopping this is for the soldiers in front here and others who are not present - and it is also the duty of all Rwandans present here and those who are not present - who understand that such acts do not benefit the country but discourage everybody... I would also like to call on Rwandans not to be misled by rumours. I urge Rwandans not to listen to some rumours which are spread among the people, some which are believed. Those who spread them are those who invented them in order to create the desired effect. Some rumours are aimed at businessmen, successful people in the country and intellectuals, saying they have had their day and that they will be killed. I would like to tell those who believe them that they are unfounded. Whoever does such a thing is a criminal like all the ones described before, and our plans for them are similar to all the others.","""1996-07-05T00:00:00Z""","""3S51-J370-0017-G31M-00000-00"""

./samples/,"From AP-Reuters KINSHASA, Zaire (CP) - A smiling but tired-looking President Mobutu Sese Seko emerged from seclusion Sunday in an appearance designed to show he is still in control in his war-ravaged country. Wearing his signature leopard-skin cap and waving a wooden cane, Mobutu walked slowly out of his residence on the Zaire River in his first public appearance since returning home Friday to face the rebellion that has been raging in Zaire for the last five months. ""I didn't come back to busy myself with the interests of Mobutu, nor the fortune of Mobutu, as you write from time to time,''  he told journalists. Instead Mobutu, who met Sunday with South African peace broker Thabo Mbeki, pledged himself to ""the highest interest of Zaire - that is to say our unity and our territorial integrity.''  Mobutu brushed off questions about whether he was willing to meet rebel leader Laurent Kabila, whose forces have taken nearly a third of the country. Asked what his role would be in efforts to forge a national reconciliation, he said only: ""You will know within the next 48 hours.''  Mbeki said after the half-hour meeting that he had delievered a letter from South African President Nelson Mandela and that a UN peace plan for a truce followed by talks was at the heart of efforts to end the conflict. Mbeki aides said Mobutu had promised a reply within two days. ""We are convinced that in the immediate future steps will be taken practically to move the peace process forward toward a resolution,''  Mbeki said. Mobutu, 66 and wasting from prostate cancer, moved slowly and spoke only for a moment in his first appearance since returning from Europe, where he'd gone for treatment and convalescence. In contrast to his return in December, when he was greeted by tens of thousands of well-wishers hoping he would end the war, Mobutu's strongmen ushered dignitaries and journalists out of the airport before he could be seen. This spurred rumors that he was near death. When asked Sunday how his health was, he smiled and replied: ""As you see me.''  Kabila, whose popularity has been rising with each battlefield victory, called Saturday for a transitional government but said he would not work with anyone who had shared power with Mobutu. Any transitional government should include his Alliance for Democratic Forces for the Liberation Congo-Zaire ""and only anti-Mobutists and anti-regime people who have never been in power and who never shared power,''  Kabila said. Previously the rebels had said the would stop fighting only after Mobutu holds direct talks with Kabila. Mobutu has so far refused. However, he announced Thursday from France that he intended to call for a national council that would bring all sides together - ""excluding no one''  - to reunite the nation. The president also said recently that general elections are crucial to Zaire's development. Though Mobutu has reneged on promises of a transition to democracy for years, many observers believe he may finally step down, return to his hometown to prepare for his death. Mobutu, 66, has ruled Zaire since seizing power in an army coup in 1965, but many ordinary Zairians, ground down by decades of poverty and hardship under his rule, are eager for a change and are openly rallying to Kabila.","""1997-03-23T00:00:00Z""","""475J-W770-01KD-R4K6-00000-00"""

Richardson said he would meet with the ailing president Tuesday. He intends to travel to the rebel-held southern city of Lubumbashi the following day to talk with rebel leader Laurent Kabila. ''The U.S. Administration believes there can be no military solution, but rather a negotiated settlement...leading to an inclusive transitional government and free and fair elections,''  he told reporters upon arrival in Kinshasa. Efforts in recent weeks to arrange a meeting between Kabila and Mobutu have failed, though officials close to the negotiations say talks between the two men could take place this week in neighboring Gabon. Richardson spoke briefly about also working to get relief supplies to some 100,000 Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire. He said he would press for access to the refugees and displaced Zairians to assess the situation there.

The United States is pushing strongly for a cease-fire and negotiations leading to an inclusive transitional government, Richardson said. Then, the United States would like to see Zairians hold elections, he said. Mobutu, 66, has insisted he would never bow to Kabila's demand he resign, but he is under increasing pressure.

./samples/,"Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko finally reached the ship where he will hold his first face-to-face talks with rebel leader Laurent Kabila, and aides insisted today he would not resign. Earlier, Mobutu had balked at getting on a helicopter to the ship and appeared too weak to drive to the dock and climb up 31 steep stairs to get aboard the South African naval vessel. Zairian Foreign Minister Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda said doctors had warned that the helicopter vibrations would be too hard on Mobutu, 66, who suffers from prostate cancer. Five hours later, a plank was lowered from the ship and Mobutu was driven aboard a side portal of the SAS Outeniqua. He did not speak to reporters, but waved and smiled through the car window. When asked whether Mobutu would step down after nearly 32 years in power - which Kabila has demanded before agreeing to a cease-fire - Mobutu chief of staff Felix Vunduwe said, ""No. Why should he?"" ""They have come to obtain a cease-fire and to obtain a precise framework for negotiations about the transition process,"" Vunduwe said. Kabila's troops, which have already captured more than half the country, are reported to be advancing toward Kinshasa, the capital. South African President Nelson Mandela was ready and waiting on the ship to help mediate the talks. ""We are dealing with two outstanding leaders who are conscious of the importance of an amiable settlement which will satisfy both of them, as well as the people of Zaire,"" Mandela said. Today, Kabila held 3 hours of talks with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in Luanda. Officials there said Kabila was delayed in Luanda and it was not clear he would make it to the ship before nightfall. The ship sail for international waters tonight, where Mandela and U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun will preside over the talks. Kabila apparently was to be flown aboard sometime later. U.S. envoy Bill Richardson, who has been in the region since Monday brokering the peace talks, said today ""the main elements of any agreement will be dealt with by the Zairians themselves."" Mobutu has insisted he would never bow to Kabila's demand to resign, but he is under intense international pressure to step down. The United States and other countries want a cease-fire, the establishment of a transitional government that includes rebels and opposition parties, and a plan for free, fair elections. In the northeastern city of Kisangani, meanwhile, U.N. aid workers flew nearly 800 Rwandan refugees home today and tried to care for several thousand others. On Thursday, more than 1,500 were flown out of eastern Zaire. After weeks of delaying tactics, rebels want the United Nations to quickly repatriate the 80,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees in camps south of Kisangani. The refugees fled into the dense jungle last week when Zairian mobs attacked them, reportedly killing hundreds. Thousands have emerged in the last few days, vainly searching for food and medicine. A U.N. team in Geneva today was preparing to investigate alleged massacres at the Zairian refugee camps. U.N. spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said the three investigators, who plan to leave Saturday for Goma via Rwanda, expect full access to suspected mass graves in eastern Zaire. In Lubumbashi, an American diamond miner said troops from Angola as well as Angolan tanks were involved in the rebel push toward the capital. A U.S. official in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Angolan troops were massing at the border, near Kinshasa. The United States has warned Angola not to get involved in Zaire's conflict. Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura today denied that Angolan troops were fighting alongside rebels.

Before the lavish opening ceremony one of the two men representing the alliance here said the summit could lead to negotiations with Kinshasa. The summit ""will determine what will follow, whether negotiations can take place. That's why we came, otherwise there would be no point,"" Gaetan Kakudji told journalists. When the ceremony finally started after a two hour delay, more than 1,000 people clad in clothes bearing Eyadema's portrait, mostly women, came to life and sang ""Welcome to Togo,"" in both English and French. These, two 50-strong choirs dressed entirely in white as well as a brass band, occasionally interrupted the discourses of the speakers. ""Peace, oh peace, oh God peace for Zaire... for all Africa,"" they sang, each waving two white handkerchiefs in time to the music. After breaking for lunch, the heads of state were due to reconvene behind closed doors. afm/fxh/msa AFP LOME, March 26 (AFP) - A summit held here Wednesday on the crisis in Zaire should lead to direct talks between that country's warring parties, Togo's Foreign Minister told AFP. ""Consultations are underway and should lead to negotiations,"" said Koffi Panou shortly before some 15 African heads of state adjourned a summit organised by the Organisation of African Unity. The summit was the first international meeting to bring together delegates from both Kinshasa's transitional government and Laurent-Desire Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire. ""We do not need to provoke the meeting. It will happen naturally because the two parties attract each other like magnets,"" Panou said. The warring parties had not had any direct contact with each other by 9:30 p.m. (2130 GMT) Wednesday. But Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema received both delegations at length in the presence of the acting OAU chairman, President Paul Biya of Cameroon, several well-placed sources said. Most sources at the summit believed all concerned were in favour of negotiations and that what had to be settled was rather their venue and date. It was unclear late Wednesday whether the summit, the entire agenda of which was delayed several hours, would continue formally on Thursday. Informal consultations, however, were expected to continue into the night. mle-afm/rom AFP afp","""1997-03-26T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-3HF0-0025-F0TV-00000-00"""
./samples/,"At a victory celebration that has become the hallmark of his rebellion, rebel leader Laurent Kabila told a cheering crowd Saturday that he would press on to the capital, Kinshasa. ''We have to prepare ourselves for the war to push out that devil (Mobutu)... This war is not yet finished, Kinshasa is not yet liberated,''  Kabila told about 12,000 people packed into a soccer stadium in Kenya township, a neighborhood in Zaire's second-largest city. In a speech that rambled for nearly three hours, Kabila said President Mobutu Sese Seko's supporters ''should know that they are completely finished.''  Kabila's rhetoric stood in contrast to comments from Mobutu's entourage that the ailing political veteran would, in principle, meet with Kabila but would not agree to step down. Security by troops from the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire was the tightest yet at a Kabila victory rally. The 56-year-old rebel leader has made a practice of holding a rally in every major town and city his forces have taken. But Saturday's gathering, held on the home turf of the regional UFERI party that favors autonomy if not outright secession of mineral-rich Shaba region was less enthusiastic than earlier rallies held in Mbuji-Mayi, Kisangani or Uvira. Rebels took Lubumbashi on April 11. Kabila postponed the rally twice and changed the venue three times, apparently out of concern for disruptions by UFERI members after rebels ousted their regional governor and replaced him with a Kabila cousin. Although Kabila spent much of his speech addressing local political concerns and telling the crowd that he was aware of the special problems in the region, he reiterated his ban on political movements other than his own at least until all of Zaire was under rebel control. ''I want you to put your political parties in a suitcase and close it up. Once the bag is closed, join us and we will chase Mobutu Sese Seko out together,''  he said in Swahili. ''Once that is done, we will have a transitional government and democracy, and then you can open the suitcase again and take out your political beliefs.''  The rebels who claim to be only 300 kilometers (180 miles) from the capital, have denied recent reports that they are being aided by Angolan soldiers. There were at least a dozen soldiers in Angolan military uniforms and speaking Portuguese on Thursday at the Hotel Karavia in Lumbumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city now in rebel hands. They refused to speak to reporters. ''There is a condition called delusion. You reporters are suffering from it,''  rebel foreign minister Bizima Karaha told reporters Friday. ''You are deluded if you think you saw Angolan soldiers here.''","""1997-04-19T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-5960-00BT-M3SS-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Peace talks appeared imminent in the seven-month rebellion that has placed a large swath of territory under rebel control and shaken up the Zairian government. Government representatives and a rebel delegation began arriving Thursday in South Africa for talks aimed at ending the conflict. The leader of the government delegation, Honore Ngbanda, flew into Johannesburg Thursday night. The rebels, at their headquarters in Goma in eastern Zaire, said their delegates, Raphael Ghenda and Bizima Karaha, left Thursday for the talks. U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun, who arrived in Pretoria on Wednesday, was expected to lead the talks. Rebels said their forces were moving by train toward Lubumbashi, the country's second-largest city on the southern border with Zambia. They said their troops were less than 65 miles (105 kilometers) from the city. There was no indication on when the peace talks would begin. The rebels have continued to say they will be satisfied with nothing less than the ouster of President Mobutu Sese Seko. On Thursday, the rebels rejected an offer by newly-appointed Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi to accept six Cabinet seats in a new interim government. Tshisekedi (pronounced CHEE-sa-kedie), on his first day in office Thursday, annulled the constitution and dissolved the parliament of 740 members to establish the transitional government and prepare the country for its first multiparty elections since Mobutu seized power in 1965. He did not set a date. Politicians from all sides were stunned by Tshisekedi's actions. ''I don't know where he gets this power to dismiss Parliament. The constitution won't be abrogated just because a citizen gets up and says it is,''  said the old parliament's speaker, Anzuluni Bembe, who was among the political elite who elected Tshisekedi. ''I believe that we are entering a new crisis,''  said Mobutu spokesman Kabuya Lumuna Sando. ''I can't understand how Tshisekedi, named by virtue of a certain constitutional passage, now rejects it entirely.''  A national conference of delegates from the government, the opposition and civic groups elected Tshisekedi to his first stint as prime minister in 1992, after Mobutu bowed to demands for democratic reforms. But the president refused to confirm his enemy in the job and Tshisekedi eventually was replaced with a string of other prime ministers, including just-ousted Prime Minister Leon Kengo wa Dondo. The transitional parliament Tshisekedi proposed would be comprised of delegates from the 1992 national conference, and except for those offered to the rebels, all of the 19 Cabinet seats went to loyal members of his previous government. None went to people in Mobutu's camp. Tshisekedi's appeal to the rebels means little to the leader of the seven-month rebellion. Laurent Kabila has called Tshisekedi a sellout for serving under the ailing president. Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire continues to gain territory as Zairian soldiers clear out of each town the rebels approach. After seven months of fighting, the rebels now control a third of Zaire. The United Nations says an estimated 100,000 Rwandan refugees in rebel-controlled territory are in desperate physical condition after months without adequate food and shelter. The rebels claim the refugees include many of those responsible for the 1994 mass slaughter of up to a half-million Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda. The refugees fled to Zaire to escape reprisals. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the United States has given the United Nations dlrs 3 million to pay for a plane to fly Rwandan refugees out of the Kisangani area if Kabila approves the plan.","""1997-04-03T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-5610-00BT-M3KP-00000-00"""

./samples/,"With the last military defenses east of this capital city crumbling, a special White House envoy arrived here today carrying a message from President Clinton to the Zairian leader, Mobutu Sese Seko, reportedly urging him to step down to avoid further bloodshed for his country. The envoy, Bill Richardson, the United States delegate to the United Nations, is scheduled to meet with Mr. Mobutu early on Tuesday, apparently in an effort to persuade him to agree without delay to transitional arrangements that would end his reign after nearly 32 years in power. The contents of Mr. Clinton's letter to Mr. Mobutu were being closely guarded. But Mr. Richardson, in a brief statement upon his arrival, said that he would be urging both the Zairian President, 66, who is gravely ill with prostate cancer, and Laurent Kabila, the rebel leader who controls most of Zaire and now threatens to capture Kinshasa, to quickly agree to the terms of a peaceful transition. ""The United States strongly believes that there can be no military solution to the crisis, but rather a negotiated settlement leading to an inclusive transitional government and fair and free elections,"" Mr. Richardson said. He added that he was bearing a message for Mr. Kabila saying that the rights of refugees in rebel-controlled areas must be respected. There have been reports of atrocities against Rwandan Hutu refugees by Mr. Kabila's forces. Mr. Richardson plans to fly from Kinshasa to the southern Zairian city of Lubumbashi to meet with Mr. Kabila on Tuesday, and will continue on to Angola, where the Government and Unita, a former rebel movement in that country that now holds seats in Parliament, are believed to have taken opposite sides in the Zairian conflict. For several days now, Mr. Mobutu and Mr. Kabila have agreed on the principle of a meeting, but they have differed sharply both on an agenda and on a place to conduct their talks. Mr. Kabila, who now appears to be militarily unstoppable, has said that he will settle for nothing less than a full handover of power. Even as Mr. Richardson was arriving today to try to bring about talks between the two leaders, news began spreading in Kinshasa of the fall of the city of Kikwit, a town 240 miles to the east of here that is the last major city between the rebel-held east and the capital. Rebels now hold about two-thirds of Zaire. There were also reports that a nearby provincial capital, Bandundu, was being looted tonight by Government forces. ""Our men threw in the towel and have completely let us down,"" said one senior Zairian military officer who said that the Government had expected a hardy defense of Kikwit. ""Now the rebels are a four-hour train ride away from here and can arrive at any moment."" If the fall of Kikwit is confirmed, many fear a panic in Kinshasa, which relies heavily on neighboring areas to the east for its food supplies. There were devastating episodes of pillaging by the military during political crises here in 1991 and 1993, and residents in the capital are already bracing for a repeat of these troubles as Mr. Kabila's forces draw nearer. Kinshasa's sensitivity toward events in Kikwit was dramatically demonstrated during an outbreak of the Ebola virus in that city two years ago, which immediately set off a panic in the capital. In anticipation of widespread unrest here, the United States, France and Belgium have all stationed troops in the Congolese capital, Brazzaville, just across the broad Congo River from Kinshasa. With Mr. Kabila's troops advancing with little difficulty and Mr. Mobutu, a man who has pledged that he would never be known as an ex-President, showing no signs of surrendering power, the prospects for Mr. Richardson's diplomacy seemed uncertain at best today. As Mr. Kabila has drawn closer to his goal of toppling Mr. Mobutu, Washington has appeared to cool significantly toward the rebel leader. Concern has arisen over statements he has made that suggest he does not intend to build a democratic government if he takes power in Zaire. Mr. Kabila has stated, for example, that after taking power he would form a transitional government composed solely of members of his own Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, shutting out other opponents of Mr. Mobutu. In addition, in the last week there have been widespread international statements of concern that Mr. Kabila's troops, who have been strongly supported by Rwanda's Tutsi-led Government, have committed atrocities against Rwandan Hutu refugees in Zaire. Mr. Richardson himself referred today to ""reports of massacres,"" saying ""this must end.""","""1997-04-29T00:00:00Z""","""3SP8-7VP0-000P-N4JD-00000-00"""
./samples/,"The United States hopes to bolster its stature in Africa by stepping up its involvement in Zaire but the effort to stop the bloodshed there is riddled with uncertainties, analysts say. With nine countries on its border and the second largest land mass in Africa, Zaire's fate is closely linked to that of the entire continent, where the United States has growing trade and investment interests. By dispatching troubleshooter Bill Richardson to the region, Washington hopes to put Zaire firmly on the path towards stability with a transitional government, although its precise form has yet to be determined. determined. ""Clearly, this is the end game,"" says Ernest Wilson, a former analyst on Africa at the National Security Council who now heads the Center for International Development and Conflict Management. In Washington's view, the final struggle involves three major power-brokers: President Mobutu Sese Seko, rebel leader Laurent Kabila and opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi. Mobutu, who for the past seven years has resisted US pressure to democratize, is now being pressed to leave power, even though it remains unclear whether he may still play a role in a transitional arrangement. Kabila, whose forces currently hold more than half of Zaire, remains overall an unknown quantity to Washington, with many Africa analysts here saying he does not have the stature to handle the affairs of state. ""I don't think that they (the United States) have enough information to have a real view"" of Kabila's potential, says Gay McDougall, director of the International Human Rights Law Group, which has worked in Zaire. As his forces sweep across eastern and central Zaire, Kabila finds momentum to be on his side and ""sees no reason why he should negotiate,"" says McDougall. Reports of refugee massacres by members of Kabila's alliance are also tarnishing the rebel leader's democratic credentials and threaten to leave him out of the circle of legitimate decision-making. Tshisekedi, who had a brief four-day stint as prime minister earlier this month, was unsuccessful in his bid to challenge Mobutu's rule but still remains popular. ""We'll have to see what happens to the traditional opposition,"" says Christopher Hurd, from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""People have rallied around Tshisekedi,"" Hurd says, but Kabila has so far resisted his overtures. Beyond the internal challenges, the United States sees international and domestic implications to the worsening conflict in Zaire. Without strong US engagement at this juncture, the conflict may spill over into other nations, opening the prospect of a military intervention in central Africa that Washington hopes to avoid at all cost, says Wilson. The United States has pre-positioned military forces in the region in the event of an escalation that would require an evacuation of American citizens. Further bloodshed in Zaire would also strain ties between France and the United States, and also affect Washington's relations with other African leaders trying to cast off the legacy of colonialism and authoritarian regimes in their countries. cml/rl rl","""1997-04-29T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-38P0-0025-F4DN-00000-00"""

./samples/,"Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila snubbed President Mobutu Sese Seko on Friday, refusing to show for a long-awaited face-to-face meeting to determine the country's future, South African radio reported. Kabila was to meet with Mobutu on board a South African navy icebreaker in a session brokered by President Nelson Mandela. But the exceptional encounter fell through after Kabila cited concerns over security arrangements. Kabila, who was to join the two on board the SAS Outeniqua by flying to the ship by helicopter from the Angolan capital Luanda, said at a later news conference that he was not pleased that the circle of talks participants had been expanded without his prior consent. He said the South Africans had promised to include him in the discussions about security, but that this was not the case. South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was to brief him about new security arrangements on Saturday before would decide whether to join the talks. Mobutu and Mandela earlier went aboard the ship in the Congolese port of Pointe Noire. Mobutu's ill health caused almost five hours of delay because he could not climb the 31 metal steps to get aboard the ship. The problem was finally solved by lowering a make-shift gateway over which he was driven by car on board the vessel. According to Zaire's Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda doctors had advised the cancer-stricken Mobutu against travelling by helicopter as originally planned because the vibrations would be bad for him. Mandela had earlier expressed optimism that the talks would take place. ""I am confident the two leaders realize the importance of a peaceful settlement,"" he said adding: ""I know few leaders who have made military gains and nevertheless been committed to peace as Mr. Kabila has."" United States special envoy Bill Richardson echoed Mandela's optimism adding he hoped the meeting would lead to a transfer of power and, hopefully, an inclusive transitional government.

Representatives of the CAR's partners have reaffirmed this, following two days of consultations in Bangui. The consultations made them familiar with the guidelines of the unity government's emergency programme. Alain George Ngatoua reports from Bangui. [Ngatoua - recording] The unity government's emergency programme is based on the restoration and maintenance of public security and the control of public finance, education and health. Although an increase in public revenue and the sanitizing of public expenditure constitute the main concerns, the issue of restoring security has received increased attention. Without stability and civil peace, one cannot envisage donor support for the economic recovery effort. This will cost more than 25bn CFA francs, according to estimates made after the two armed uprisings and the looting which ensued. Emphasis has been placed on making the people aware of the need to reinforce the dialogue with the authorities on the recovery of weapons.

./samples/,"A soldier was shot and killed in the troubled territory of East Timor on Indonesian election day, a Western source said from the territory Friday. The soldier was shot in Ermera, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the capital Dili early Thursday, the source said. However, the East Timor military command information office declined Friday to confirm the report. report. A spokesman, Lieutenant Abidin said only that he had heard that a soldier had been shot in Ermera on Thursday. A total of 15 people were killed in pre-election attacks in East Timor by separatist rebels between Tuesday and early Thursday. jth/bsp/sjc/cmc Nobel peace laureate Jose Ramos Horta on Friday called on Indonesian President Suharto to make sure people in East Timor can live in peace after violence marred Indonesian polls in the troubled region. Before and during the elections 17 people were killed in violence in the enclave and throughout the island nation more than 250 died. The 27-day election campaign period, which ended on May 23, was dubbed the most violent since Suharto came to power in the mid 1960s. ""The high number of casualties is proof of the instability that prevails in Indonesia and of the deep-rooted lack of satisfaction of its people after three decades of authoritarian rule,"" said Ramos Horta. He said Suharto must seize his last chance to make sure that Indonesia's future is peaceful, by voiding the election results, recognizing reality and respecting his people and that of the people of East Timor. ""But Suharto who is the oldest still ruling dictator after the fall of (Zaire's) Mobutu (Sese Seko), seems to be turning a deaf ear to his people's just demands for change and democratic participation,"" said Ramos Horta. ""He rather seeks to make public opinion swallow the fraudulent results of his last election farce."" Indonesia's ruling Golkar party was on target Friday to win well over the 70 percent of the vote it wanted in the country's general elections. The ruling party had set a target of 70.02 percent of the vote, up from 68.1 percent at the last election in 1992 and was well on the way to achieving this, analysts said. A UN spokesman said Thursday that UN-sponsored talks between Portugal and Indonesia focusing on prospects for a political solution for East Timor are expected to be held in mid-June. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed the former Portuguese territory the following year in a move never recognised by the United Nations. em/gk/bb bb","""1997-05-30T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-32V0-0025-F4CT-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Mediators finally got the grudging president of Zaire aboard a ship for peace talks Friday, only to find that his rebel enemy was balking. Rebel leader Laurent Kabila said he wanted more safety guarantees and would decide Saturday whether to attend the talks with President Mobutu Sese Seko after seeing a new security report from the South African officials organizing the meeting. Kabila complained that the South Africans were concerned only with Mobutu's safety. He also claimed he'd never received a formal invitation. ""I wasn't invited,"" Kabila said. ""I heard it on the radio, but I got no official invitation."" Kabila made the announcement to reporters in the Angolan capital of Luanda, hours after Mobutu and international mediators had boarded the South African navy ship at Pointe Noire, Congo. When it became clear Kabila would not come, the ship returned to harbor. Mobutu disembarked to stay spend the night in Pointe Noire, while South African President Nelson Mandela and U.S. envoy Bill Richardson remained aboard, apparently to continue consultations. Kabila's apparent stalling tactic came a day after Mobutu himself hedged on attending the summit, failing to show up at the airport for a flight to the talks. Zairian officials blamed the delay on logistical problems. Aziz Pahad, South Africa's deputy foreign minister, told reporters on the ship that he's still hopeful the talks will go forward Saturday. Asked whether Kabila was playing games by not showing up, he replied: ""With such international representation, I would hope that there are no games."" Mediators fear the peace talks - the first face-to-face showdown between the two rivals - may be the last chance to prevent the rebels from forcibly taking the Zairian capital. Rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire are only 250 miles from Kinshasa. Kabila reiterated Friday night that he would go to the talks only to negotiate ""Mobutu's exit and the handover of power to the Alliance."" Otherwise, he said, rebel forces would take the rest of Zaire within two weeks. In Washington, the State Department expressed disappointment with Kabila's delay. Press officer Elaine McDevitt said it runs counter to assurances he had given to South African and U.N. officials. Kabila was to have been escorted to SAS Outeniqua by South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki: Instead, the official arrived with a message from the rebel leader. The Zairian president himself had been reluctant to board the ship, saying the vibrations of the helicopter that was to carry him aboard would be bad for his cancer-ridden body. After a five-hour delay, a plank was lowered from the ship and Mobutu was driven aboard a side portal. He did not speak to reporters, but waved and smiled through the car window. Mobutu has insisted he would never bow to Kabila's demand to resign, but his illness and the international pressure to step down may force him to do so. When asked whether Mobutu was there to announce he would step down, Mobutu chief of staff Felix Vunduwe, said, ""No. Why should he?"" ""They have come to obtain a cease-fire and to obtain a precise framework for negotiations about the transition process,"" Vunduwe said. Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has been in the region since Monday helping broker the peace talks. He said before boarding the ship that ""the main elements of any agreement will be dealt with by the Zairians themselves."" ""In my view, this meeting will produce a process that involves a transfer of power and hopefully a transitional, inclusive government,"" Richardson added. The United States and other countries want a cease-fire, the establishment of a transitional government that includes rebels and opposition parties, and a plan for free, fair elections. Mandela was to help mediate the talks with U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun. ""I am confident the two leaders realize the importance of a peaceful settlement,"" Mandela said. ""I know few leaders who have made military gains and nevertheless been committed to peace as Mr. Kabila has."" Kabila had held 3 hours of talks with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in Luanda on Friday and left the presidential palace without speaking to reporters. On Thursday, a U.S. State Department official in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Angola was massing troops in its Cabinda region, which is within striking distance of Kinshasa. The United States has warned Angola not to get involved in the conflict in Zaire. Richardson was in Luanda early Friday to discuss the issue. Richardson said that in a ""very productive"" meeting with the Angolan president he had ""conveyed Washington's concerns about Angola's involvement in Zaire."" ""Angola must be a leader in the peaceful reconstruction of Zaire,"" Richardson told reporters. Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura on Friday denied reports that Angolan troops were fighting alongside the rebels. ""Once again, we categorically deny (these reports). We want for there to be a peaceful process in Zaire, which will modify the regime which for about 32 years systematically destabilized Angola,"" de Moura said.

./samples/,"Kabila, in what amounted to a victory speech Saturday, said Mobutu could remain in his home village of Gbadolite in the north, where he went Friday. Mobutu, 66 and dying of cancer, was expected to head to Morocco and eventually on to Paris although by evening Saturday, western diplomats were saying he was staying in Gbadolite. Exile was beginning to look grimmer for Mobutu, with the Swiss government announcing Saturday that it was blocking all his family's assets in Switzerland in response to a request from what it judged was the competent justice authority in Zaire, the prosecutor in the second-largest city, Lubumbashi. Kabila said he would form a transitional government within 72 hours and within 60 days there would be a new constitution. He made no mention of elections that he has promised, and that the West has pressed him to call within months of a takeover. During his march across Zaire, Kabila has promised to undo the damage wrought by Mobutu's nearly 32 years in power. But he has been short on specifics, and his troops have been accused of atrocities against refugees during their eight-month march across Zaire.

./samples/,"It's only an exercise. But the bodies lying at each end of the bridge look real enough, and the goal is deadly serious - training African soldiers to keep the peace in their continent's hot spots. In the carefully scripted practice, peacekeepers stand guard at the bridge, keeping watch over rival militiamen waiting nervously to swap their dead as the first step toward a peace accord. The atmosphere is tense, and anything unexpected could trigger a firefight. The trainees are being taught how to keep the parties calm while dealing with the unforeseen, such as the U.N. helicopter that suddenly approaches. A quick shout into a walkie-talkie, and the aircraft veers away. ""We had to tell the pilot to turn sharply away. That could have spoiled everything,"" says Col. Tony Potter of Britain, one of the trainers. The recent Exercise ""Blue Hungwe"" (Blue Eagle) in the mountainous bush of eastern Zimbabwe was the first attempt to train African armies in joint peacekeeping operations. Organized by Britain and Zimbabwe, it brought together 1,400 soldiers from 10 African countries. The idea is simple: Wealthy industrial nations pay for and train a force of African soldiers capable of responding quickly and acceptably across the continent. That is consistent with calls by African leaders like South African President Nelson Mandela for ""African solutions to African problems."" They want to show the world Africa can police itself and be a partner in creating stability. It also would help Western powers avoid a repeat of missions such as Somalia, where a two-year, $2 billion peacekeeping operation resulted in the deaths of more than 100 U.N. soldiers and no resolution of the clan feuding. The two-week Blue Hungwe exercise gave participants a taste of the complexities that have stymied other international efforts in Africa. For example, the body exchange, supervised by Red Cross officials with hand-held radios, was intended to establish contact between the belligerents as a prelude to a hoped-for prisoner swap and peace talks. Details were exact, down to ketchup-like paint smeared on the ""corpses."" ""It's a moment of trust between the two parties. The peacekeepers are here to stop any treacherous event and provide neutral pallbearers,"" said Dominic Dufour of the Geneva-based International Red Cross. ""It has been absolutely realistic."" While African contingents have joined Western-led U.N. operations in Africa, such as in Somalia, the idea for predominantly African intervention has arisen only in recent years. The switch in emphasis came after Somalia, where racial scandal tainted Canadian and Belgian troops and American units were bloodied. ""They don't want to see body bags. They don't want to see white soldiers putting down blacks in Africa or be accused of racism. It makes sense to train Africans to do the job,"" said Michael Guerra-Quintana, an international defense consultant. But, he concedes, it may not be easy. While impoverished African governments have never been shy to accept money from the West, they would insist on total command and control of any military operation without outside interference. ""They don't want to be seen as stooges,"" Guerra-Quintana said. ""And that's going to present problems to paymasters who will inevitably want some say,"" fearing failures like those that bedeviled the peacekeeping force formed by West African nations to deal with Liberia's civil war. Analysts say the West African force had several problems: a fractured command structure dominated by Nigeria, lack of unity and discipline, vague objectives, political rivalries that led to favoritism for certain Liberian factions, corruption and looting. Africa's notoriously slow bureaucracy also could be a problem. Reaching consensus among governments is a long process that often ends in compromise, half-measures and even inaction. ""We have seen crisis summits every few months that don't achieve much at all. Even if some will was there, we have seen no relevant African military intervention in major African theaters,"" Guerra-Quintana said. American military officers have a different spin, and they don't rule out active participation by Western troops. Col. David McCracken, commander of the 3rd Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg, N.C., said the United States had no intention of paying for or creating a costly, unmanageable African intervention army. Instead, it wants to train 10 African battalions across the continent over the next five years and have them participate in two annual combined exercises with American forces. McCracken says such troops trained in common tactics would give African nations the ability to decide whether to commit to a specific crisis under United Nations or regional mandates. U.S. troops could even be deployed again on African soil, he said. ""Instead of mobilizing three U.S. battalions to a crisis site, we'd take only one to work with two African battalions we trained with and understand,"" McCracken said. That seems a long way off, especially with hostilities continuing in Zaire and Sudan and instability rife in Burundi, Algeria and other spots. South Africa, the region's strongest military power, has so far stayed out of peacekeeping missions. Just three years after its first all-race elections, apartheid-era guerrillas are still being integrated into the army, and troops also are assisting civilian police. ""Of course, it is up to the politicians, but the military view is we're nowhere near ready to commit ourselves,"" said Col. Chris du Toit, who commanded 300 South African soldiers sent to Nyanga for the exercise. The shadow of expensive peacekeeping failures across Africa lingers. Aside from Somalia, U.N. missions in Angola and Rwanda were either under strength or underestimated their task, said Mark Malan, a senior researcher for a South African strategic studies think tank. While U.N. troops provided security during two-year transitions from civil war to a peaceful election in Mozambique and the installation of a unity government in Angola, the costs were high and the delays frequent. Angola cost an estimated $1 million a day. ""When there is no articulated doctrine of how to intervene forcefully, the tendency is to stand back,"" Malan said. ""Perhaps regional organizations could determine how to wield a bigger stick."" Brig. Adrian Naughton, head of British military trainers in Zimbabwe, believes there now is a chance for armies to overcome their colonial histories and lack of cooperation. ""Yes, I agree Africa couldn't stop Angola or Rwanda, but it did put out bush fires like the small mutiny here and there,"" Naughton said. ""Maybe we're now at a very early stage of the turning point.""","""1997-05-25T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-83P0-000Y-K559-00000-00"""

./samples/,"Ragtag rebel forces marched into Zaire's capital on Saturday to the cheers of eager crowds, and a beaming Laurent Kabila proclaimed victory in his eight-month insurgency. Deposed dictator Mobutu Sese Seko was reportedly fleeing the country for Morocco and exile. Government loyalists fled the country and Zairian soldiers put up little resistance to the final assault of rebel forces, which swept across Africa's third-largest country in just eight months. Gunfire crackled in the capital as government troops abandoned the city, looting as they went. Civilians ran jubilantly through the streets, waving palm fronds and flashing victory signs. ""Mobutu has gone crazy! We want Kabila!"" they cried. Kabila, speaking at rebel headquarters in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi, declared himself president. ""I am happy, very happy to succeed,"" he said with a broad smile. The 56-year-old rebel leader pledged to form a transitional government by Tuesday and issue a new constitution within 60 days. But he made no mention of elections the United States has pressed him to organize. The rebels also said they will change the country's name to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mobutu abandoned Kinshasa on Friday, passing control of the country to his Cabinet. His whereabouts since then have been a mystery. Aides said the cancer-stricken 66-year-old leader flew to his northern hometown of Gbadolite, 700 miles away, for a few days rest. But other officials said he traveled to Rabat, Morocco, early Sunday to begin exile. A close aide based in Paris, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that he had talked with Mobutu's son Nzanga, who said his father was still in Zaire. He said Mobuto never travels at night. But Moroccan security sources said Mobuto arrived at a military airport in Rabat at 3 a.m. Sunday. Mobutu's entourage arrived in three planes, and went to a resort on the sea just south of the Moroccan capital. A Moroccan government official said Mobutu would stop just briefly in Morocco, then go to the central European country of Liechtenstein, until after the French legislative elections, at which point he would settle into exile in France. A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said he was unaware of the report and had no immediate reaction. Kabila earlier Saturday said Mobutu could live in his village unharmed. Kabila said Zairian army generals in Kinshasa had told him they were ready to receive orders from him. Ten thousand rebel soldiers were heading into Kinshasa, he said. Western military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebels controlled the international airport and a cargo airport. By midday, rebel fighters held the Voice of Zaire radio station in central Kinshasa. Hundreds of residents celebrated outside, wearing white headbands to show support for the rebels. In their first radio broadcast late Saturday - which had to wait until an engineer could be found to run the equipment - the rebels told government troops to hand in their weapons by Sunday morning, and warned that looters would be punished. The rebels also were in control of the Parliament building, Kinshasa's sports stadium and the information ministry. The bodies of four soldiers who had resisted the rebels lay on the stadium's grounds. Most of the city appeared to be in rebel hands, but witnesses near Camp Tshatshi, the capital's main military camp and the site of Mobutu's fortress overlooking the Zaire river, said fighting continued there into the night. The threat of violence by fleeing government soldiers kept residents indoors in parts of Kinshasa. Elsewhere, crowds lined roads and leaned over balconies as rebels passed, chanting ""We're free!"" Some rushed to bring water to marching fighters. ""Oh, Kabila! Oh, Kabila!"" 18-year-old Miguel Kamputu shouted as he rolled on a filthy sidewalk then shook with laughter. ""Too much suffering. Too much suffering. He is finally here."" ""This is a very good day for us - a very good day,"" cried Honore Lubuku, happily jogging down the street. ""For 32 years we saw Mobutu steal our money, eat our food, ruin our lives. Now it's his turn to suffer."" At the Grand Market, about 300 young people faced down government troops who tried to block their way. The troops opened fire and then dispersed. Two people who appeared to be civilians were killed. Western military sources also said a Zairian soldier shot and killed Gen. Marc Mahele Lieko Bokungu, declaring him a traitor to Mobutu: The general had advised Mobutu on Thursday that soldiers would not defend the capital and urged him to leave. Mobutu's handpicked prime minister, Gen. Likulia Bolongo, had vowed in a radio broadcast Saturday to remain ""until the end,"" urging government troops to stay in their camps. But within an hour, the end had arrived: The general slipped across the Zaire River to Brazzaville, Congo, a Western diplomat said. Mobutu's son, Mobutu Kongulu - also a senior army officer - fled to Brazzaville with his family and 30 armed bodyguards. Officials of the Congo government, which is close to the Mobutu regime, greeted them warmly - then disarmed them to the cheers of onlookers. Port officials and reporters in Brazzaville said many other Mobutu generals and political cronies had arrived. Mobutu associates could be seen leaving Kinshasa in speedboats. An American evacuation team was on alert in Brazzaville - as it had been for a week - but had not received orders to evacuate the 300 or so Americans in Kinshasa, Navy Cmdr. Bob Anderson said. Kabila appealed for calm in the capital, and warned that anyone who harmed Zairians or foreigners would be ""severely sanctioned."" Kabila's soldiers have been accused of atrocities against refugees. While the rebel leader has promised to undo the damage wrought by Mobutu's nearly 32 years in power, he has been short on specifics. His backing from Rwanda and Uganda could make him suspect among some strongly nationalistic Zairians. France, which helped prop up Mobutu for years, expressed displeasure that he and Kabila had not reached a negotiated settlement, and called for elections. ""We will be very attentive to the actions of the new authorities,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

./samples/,"Deputy President Thabo Mbeki pledged Wednesday that South Africa would assist the government of the new Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) once it is announced by self-appointed president Laurent Kabila. Mbeki, the first foreign government official to hold talks with Kabila after he took power on Saturday in the DRC, formerly Zaire, said it was clear much hard work would be needed to rebuild the central African country. ""There has been a collapse of the state administration, a collapse of the public finances, a collapse in the productive capacity of a whole range of enterprises, there is endemic corruption in the country, there is a refugeee problem as well as a problem of displaced nationals,"" Mbeki told parliament. parliament. Kabila's rebel Alliance had asked for ""continuing assistance from South Africa with regard to these issues,"" he added. ""As soon as the new government has been formed, they will be in contact with us to...see what assistance--even if merely in the form of advice--we can give."" ""We are also in contact with the World Bank, who clearly must play an important role with regard to helping to resuscitate this country,"" he added. Kabila had been expected to announce a multi-party transitional government by Tuesday but, according to press reports in Kinshasa on Wednesday, delayed the announcement until after a meeting with former prime minister Etienne Tshisekedi. Mbeki blamed the delay on the fact ""the process of consultation has proved more complicated than was calculated."" He sketched the background of South Africa's attempts to mediate a peaceful transfer of power in former Zaire, but said former President Mobutu Sese Seko, who fled Kinshasa on Friday, had scuttled the plan. Although Kabila had given assurances his troops would not enter Kinshasa until the agreement had been fulfilled, he was urged ""by Western ambassadors"", after Mobutu fled, to enter the capital to maintain law and order and prevent looting. Still to be resolved, he said, was the question of peace, non-aggression, and the inviolability of borders, especially in regard to the Great Lakes region as a whole. ""I imagine that it would be expected that South Africa should continue to make whatever contribution it can to resolve these matters,"" Mbeki said. mh/br/lc A South African company which used to produce flags for the former Zaire has begun making new ones in the colours of the renamed Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a company official said Wednesday. Financial director of the National Flag Company, Estel Clingman, said the company was hoping to obtain orders for the flags from the new authorities, headed by Laurent Kabila. ""The chances are they will purchase them from us because we supplied the former Zairean government,"" Clingman said. ""We hope next week we will start to sell them to the new government."" She said the National Flag Company began producing the flags on Tuesday and had already sold 50 to various parties, which she did not identify. None had yet been bought by the new authorities. ""There is a lot of confusion around the pattern of the flag,"" she said, ""but when we know for sure that this is the correct one, we will produce it in big quantities."" The company, which began in 1981, produces by hand flags of all sizes from around the world. Employing around 100 workers, it regularly sends flags ordered by governments in Africa as well as Hong Kong, which is due to revert to Chinese rule on July 1. bmk/br/lc lc","""1997-05-21T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-34B0-0025-F37B-00000-00"""
./samples/,"As the only surgeon left in the Congo's main hospital in Leopoldville during the civil war of 1960, American missionary Bill Close was overwhelmed tending the wounds of battling African tribesmen, policemen and soldiers. Then he thought about seeking help from a young colonel named Joseph Mobutu (later to become Mobutu Sese Seko), who had seized power after the country he later renamed Zaire was granted independence from Belgium. Close, the father of actress Glenn Close, says he flagged down Mobutu's car in a paratrooper camp. Mobutu rolled down his window, clearly surprised to see a white man there, and said, ""Oui?"" ""I'm a surgeon at the Congolese General Hospital,"" Close said. ""I wondered if you could do something about the violence in town so we can catch up in the operating room."" ""Yes, I think I can,"" Mobutu replied, before driving off. Thirty-five years later, during an interview at his home here in the high plains of Wyoming, Close said he still doesn't know what Mobutu did. But not only did the tempo in the operating room soon slow down, it was the start of the doctor's intimate 16-year relationship with Mobutu, the Machiavelli of post-colonial Africa. Mobutu began calling on Close to take care of family members. (Close also attended Moise Tshombe and other political opponents of Mobutu in prison.) He spent one night in Mobutu's bedroom, the lights darkened by a power failure, waiting for a coup attempt that never developed. With the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel, Close flew a small plane to the far reaches of the sprawling country to calm unruly troops. He often traveled to fancy banquets, meeting Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie and Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, among other African leaders. He was at Mobutu's side on village visits, dispensing medicine, and listening to what the people said to their president. He also witnessed U.S. ambassadors dressing down Mobutu, a Cold War client they alternately coddled and cudgeled. ""I could not help but join in the laughter"" when Mobutu did brilliant imitations of the ambassadors as soon as they departed, Close recalls. As the country degenerated into chaos with the oil embargo of 1973 and declining copper and cobalt prices, exacerbated by Mobutu's disastrous nationalization of even petty trading shops, Close watched the president become a prisoner of his own machinations. ""How would you like to run a (expletive deleted) country like this?"" Mobutu once asked him. Mobutu and Close clashed as it became more and more difficult to get the money the doctor needed for the staff and patients of the hospital, even though the hospital had been renamed for Mobutu's late mother, Mama Yemo. Close's wife of 52 years - Bettine, or Tine as she is called - was ill with hepatitis, and he felt a growing desire ""to practice medicine with my own people."" In 1976 he decided to leave. His eldest daughter, Tina, was living in Jackson, Wyo., and the Closes bought a ranch above Big Piney to ""get off the world."" Close, a twin, was born to a well-to-do family in Greenwich, Conn., in 1924. His father, a lawyer, became the administrator of the American Hospital in Paris. After attending Harvard and marrying Tine, Close enlisted in the Army Air Corps, becoming a Troop Carrier pilot in 1943. After the war, he attended Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City under the GI Bill. By the time he graduated in 1951, he and Tine had three young children: Tina, Glenn, and a son, Sandy. After completing his residency at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, he spent six years traveling the world for a missionary group called Moral Re-Armament. The group sent Close to the Congo to do missionary work shortly before the country gained its independence from Belgium. Within a week, the army had mutinied, and he couldn't leave. He offered his services at the hospital, and soon became its only surgeon when a Belgian colleague left. Even though he has become one of Mobutu's strongest critics, he recognizes the dictator's political skills. Mobutu had a copy of ""The Prince"" on his bedside table. He believes the Machiavellian tenet that only a state without corruption can get along without a strongman or ""Sole Authority."" Close remembers Mobutu usually winning at checkers, but cheating on occasion to make sure. ""He liked to fish in a hatchery. When I pointed out this wasn't very sporting he said, 'I'm here to catch fish.' "" Mobutu also was generous, awarding Close the country's top honor, the Order of the Leopard. He gave the doctor the use of an old C-45 transport plane that President Kennedy had donated to the country earlier. Close never had a contract with Mobutu or the government. As director of the hospital, and chief doctor to the army, he was provided living quarters. He also saw private patients, and lived on that revenue until the early '70s. With growing family expenses - they now had a third daughter, Jessie - Close asked for a retainer and was given $40,000 a year. Close doesn't regret having worked for Mobutu, but, ""I left when it became impossible to continue working."" The final straw came, he says, ""when I fired a Zairean doctor for gross corruption and Mobutu insisted I take him back for political reasons. I refused."" Close came to Wyoming and set up a small clinic in Big Piney. In 1987, he began renewing his contacts in Zaire to research a book, and possibly a movie on the 1976 outbreak of the Ebola virus. Daughter Glenn traveled with him to Zaire to visit the Yambuku Catholic Mission where the epidemic first hit. When riots erupted in September 1991, Close used his contacts to develop a private newsletter on events in Zaire. He downloaded computer reports from news agencies in a basement office of his Sandhill home outside Big Piney. Reporters in Zaire often found the Sandhill report more accurate than U.S. Embassy assessments. Close also began lobbying the State Department and influential congressmen to try to persuade Mobutu to hand over power, and he spoke out publicly against the mismanagement and excesses that had impoverished the population. ""The iron fists of President Mobutu's special troops continue to repress and terrorize the people,"" Close said in an appearance before the Senate subcommittee on African Affairs in February 1992. Mobutu has retained the presidency and control of the military, but has been forced to concede some power to a transitional government. That government invited Close to return to Zaire last year to work on projects aimed at restoring some basic medical services. Close saw Mobutu for the first time in 18 years. ""We spent an hour together. Basically we talked about the situation of his people,"" Close said. Close, who had attended Mama Yemo before she died, remembers telling the president, ""We have the responsibility of keeping what hope is left alive."" Close also remembers being ""moved to tears"" by the sight of hospital staff members trudging three to four hours daily to work even though most of their patients had left because the hospital had nothing to offer them. Glenn Close, asked to describe her father, said he is ""a complex, enthusiastic, committed and meticulous humanitarian."" She once gave him a T-shirt that says: ""I'm not obsessive! I'm not obsessive! I'm not obsessive!"" His office wall bears the inscription: ""Caution! Person in this room subject to bursts of enthusiasm."" A photo of a chimpanzee bears the words: ""I've gotta learn to relax."" Tine says, ""His life has been fascinating because he made it that way."" She adds, ""I was never really worried even when he left carrying an automatic rifle. There was one time when the tower called and said he couldn't get his landing gear down, but he managed it with a superhuman effort."" In the past six years Close has been writing about his experiences. A historical novel, ""Ebola,"" was recently published and is on some best-seller lists. He is talking with publishers about republishing ""The Earth Is Not A Resting Place,"" a self-effacing collection of stories about practicing medicine from New York to Zaire to Wyoming. Neither the majestic Wind River Range to the east, Wyoming Range to the west, or his beloved dogs, seem able to more than momentarily distract this man. He has had to reduce his clinic work to one day a week. His downstairs office at home is jampacked with computers, a fax machine, copying machine, floppy disks and tape cassettes loaded with interview material. He is working on a new novel, and may be irresistibly drawn to writing about the Congo turmoil. --- Eds: Anyone interested in more information about Zaire's health care projects can contact AmeriCare's Central African Projects, 616 Cherry St., New Canaan, Conn. 06840.

./samples/,"As violence swept through the streets of Zaire's capital today, the White House sharply stepped up pressure on President Mobutu Sese Seko to step aside. In its harshest comments to date about Mr. Mobutu, a longtime American ally, the White House declared that the end of his autocratic regime was inevitable. ""Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history,"" Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, told reporters this morning. But Administration officials said they remain unsure what kind of rule might follow a collapse of Mr. Mobutu's Government and are wary of the intentions of Laurent Kabila, the leader of Zaire's rebels, who now control about a third of the country. Officials at the White House and the State Department insisted that they were not calling on President Mobutu to resign, but rather for him to help create a transitional government that would hold democratic elections. Mr. McCurry acknowledged that he was skirting the lip of such a request, saying, ""Ambiguity is an art form."" But when pressed for elaboration, he added, ""I think that it's clear that we have to move beyond President Mobutu and think about how we begin to structure a government that can address the needs of the Zairian people, and that's what the United States is committing to supporting."" Harshly repudiating a leader that successive Administrations treated as an ally for decades, Mr. McCurry defined ""Mobutuism"" as ""the state of disrepair of the Zairian political economy, the sad conditions that many people in Zaire live in now, the lack of effective political representation that the people of Zaire have suffered under for some time."" From the time he took power in 1965, Mr. Mobutu received hundreds of millions of dollars from the United States until Congress, over the objections of the Bush Administration, cut off all direct military and economic aid in 1990. The United States still provides some aid to Zaire through nongovernmental organizations. The Central Intelligence Agency worked closely with Mr. Mobutu for years, funnelling money through him to pro-Western guerrilla forces in Angola, according to Angolan military commanders and Western diplomats in Zaire. About 500 Americans remain in Zaire. American military forces are standing by directly across the Congo River from Kinshasa, the Zaire capital, prepared to evacuate them if necessary, officials said. Mr. McCurry said the American troops had been deployed only to help evacuate United States citizens in Zaire, not to play a wider role in a change in government. As reports came in about spreading violence and arrests in Kinshasa, American officials seemed uncertain about the rapidly shifting political situation there, although they said they remained in contact with Mr. Mobutu's Government. ""We may have a situation where there are two prime ministers in Zaire, or two people who say they are prime minister,"" Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said. Mr. Burns appeared to be referring to efforts today by Zaire's Prime Minister, Etienne Tshisekedi, a longtime opponent of Mr. Mobutu, to defy the state of emergency that Mr. Mobutu declared on Wednesday. Administration officials said the United States had not attempted to send signals through intermediaries to urge Mr. Mobutu to step aside. ""We couldn't do that,"" one official said. ""Mobutu could have used it against us with the French."" The French Government remains an ally of Mr. Mobutu. Bernard Valero, the press counselor of the French Embassy here, said France supported negotiations between the rebels and Mr. Mobutu's Government, which are taking place in South Africa. The United States is also supporting that process, hoping it will lead to democratic elections. An Administration official said that Washington remained unsure whether Mr. Kabila, the rebel leader, will embrace democracy. ""There's room for hope, but I don't think anyone wants to be overconfident about that,"" the official said.","""1997-04-10T00:00:00Z""","""3SP8-85G0-000P-N0VS-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Secrecy surrounded preparations for Zairian peace talks Friday as members of a rebel delegation joined the government's chief negotiator in South Africa. Officials were so close-mouthed that the chief rebel negotiator, Bizima Karaha, would not even say when he arrived, with whom he was traveling or what his plans were. ''I have arrived,''  Karaha told The Associated Press by telephone. ''I am not able to make any comment.''  Precautions were so careful that David Whaley, the resident coordinator for U.N. operations in South Africa, could not reach U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun, who is expected to lead the talks. ''I didn't think I would get through to Mr. Sahnoun, but when I couldn't reach the driver, that floored me,''  Whaley said. Whaley said the talks were likely to begin Saturday or Sunday at a secret location to escape the media spotlight. Sahnoun hopes to get the two sides to agree to a cease-fire, but there was no confirmation that they would even meet face to face. The goal could be simply to guarantee further talks. Karaha is the foreign policy adviser to rebel leader Laurent Kabila and represented the rebels at last week's Organization of African Unity summit in Lome, Togo. Honore Ngbanda, who represented President Mobutu Sese Seko at earlier talks in South Africa, flew in Thursday afternoon, then met with Sahnoun briefly, Zaire Embassy Charge d'Affaires Issa Ganda said Friday. Ngbanda was accompanied by just a few members of his delegation, likely to total at least seven. The rest were expected to arrive Friday, including members of Zairian opposition parties. Mobutu has previously demanded a cease-fire before peace talks, while Kabila has insisted on talks to work out a truce. Now it appears both sides are willing to consider a cease-fire that would take place simultaneously with peace talks. But it was unclear if the initial discussions here would carry enough significance to bring a halt to the rebel advance. Kabila's troops control about a third of the country after a six-month offensive that has met little resistance. They aim to topple Mobutu's 31-year-old dictatorship. The inclusion of opposition parties in the government negotiating team indicated Mobutu was trying to make the talks a broad forum on Zaire's conflict instead of a showdown between his teetering regime and the rebels. But growing conflict between Mobutu's supporters and opposition parties could be ''a complicating factor,''  Whaley said. Mobutu, 66 and ailing with prostate cancer, no longer exercises absolute control. Newly appointed Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, in his first day in office Thursday, offered cabinet posts to the rebels, annulled the constitution and dissolved the 740-member Parliament to establish a transitional government and prepare for the first multi-party elections since Mobutu seized power in 1965. However, Mobutu refused to join in widespread criticism of Tshisekedi, with whom he met privately at his presidential palace in Kinshasa on Friday. ''This is not an affair that concerns the head of state,''  Mobutu said, noting that the constitution bars him from annulling Parliament's decision earlier this week to appoint Tshisekedi. South Africa has a stake in successful peace talks for nearby Zaire. It seeks to establish a firm African role in solving problems on the continent and already has seen a spillover of Zaire's strife into neighboring countries. Zairian soldiers crossing the border with civilian refugees have been disarmed and arrested in Zambia. (az/pax)","""1997-04-04T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-56F0-00BT-M4CN-00000-00"""

As elsewhere in their seven month campaign, the mainly youthful troops of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire were welcomed in by celebrating crowds of civilians, joyful at the end of the rule of Mobutu Sese Seko. Meanwhile the whereabouts of Mobutu remained a mystery. mystery.

""The plane transporting the president and his family was hit by shots fired by rebel troops who attempted to seize Gbadolite airport,"" the statement said. Sources close to Morocco's foreign and interior ministries meanwhile Sunday denied reports he was staying in Rabat, the Moroccan capital, but added that Moroccan authorities remained prepared to provide a temporary welcome to Mobutu ""if necessary."" The Zairean Red Cross said at least 200 people had been killed in Kinshasa since Kabila's forces entered the capital. Sources said most of the dead were soldiers and most of the remainder were looters. Most of the 52 injured civilians, who were taken to Kinshasa's main hospital, were the victims of stray bullets, Red Cross officials said. The last government troops to hold out, around 1,000 men of the elite Special Presidential Division, laid down their weapons peacefully at Tshatshi military camp. The surrender emphasised the largely peaceful transfer of power here. In Kabila's southeastern stronghold of Lubumbashi, South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki opened the way to worldwide acknowledgement of this African nation's new regime, telling journalists after a meeting with Kabila that his government recognised Kabila as president. Other African countries had already pledged their support Saturday and Sunday, but the combination of South Africa's announcement and indications the United States is edging towards official recognition suggest international approval is imminent. Saturday, just after his forces seized Kinshasa, Kabila declared himself president, promised to form a transitional government by Tuesday and to call a constituent assembly within 60 days. He also announced that Zaire would now be known as ""The Democratic Republic of Congo""--its name in 1965 when Mobutu took power. Mbeki, who met Kabila with South African Defence Minister Joe Modise and Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, said he was satisfied the transitional government would be broad-based. ""It's important during this transitional period that the people should enjoy democratic rights and democratic freedoms,"" he said. Just hours earlier in Lumbubashi, UN special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun said he had held ""very encouraging"" talks with Kabila on ""the future of governance in Zaire, and democracy."" Sahnoun said it appeared ""that the people of Zaire are happy"" to have Kabila take over. Organisation of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim had said in a statement issued from Addis Ababa Saturday: ""We look forward to working with Kabila and his new administration,"" even referring to the rebel leader as ""President Kabila."" Without being so forthright, the United States nevertheless said Sunday it would work with Kabila. Speaking to television network CNN, White House national security adviser Sandy Berger said: ""Through our embassy we have urged (Kabila) to respect human rights, urged him to form a government that is inclusive and ultimately to move towards democracy and we are going to continue to work with him towards that."" Berger added that Washington has ""maintained contact"" with Kabila through Bill Richardson, the US ambassador to the United Nations. Meanwhile, 110 members of Mobutu's family were still waiting late Sunday at Brazzaville airport as authorities tried to find a country willing to take them in, police said. The group of 110 people had attempted to fly to neighbouring Gabon early Sunday morning but the aircraft was forced to turn around after failing to receive landing permission. bur/pcj/mb Self-proclaimed Zairean president Laurent Kabila is a ""pragmatic"" person who ""may learn about the needs of a modern, open economy,"" US Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson said in Newsweek magazine. Richardson, who wrote the article before Kabila's rebel troops took Kinshasa Saturday, spelled out what Kabila must do to win US support in the magazine's latest issue, due out Monday. ""If there is a peaceful entry into Kinshasa, if he forms a broad-based political coalition, if he makes progress on helping the refugees and punishes his troops who are responsible for any abuses, if he commits himself to democratic elections, human rights and responsible economic policies--then he'll have made a good start,"" Richardson wrote. At least 200 people--most of them soldiers--have been killed in Kinshasa since Kabila's forces seized the capital, Zairean Red Cross officials said Sunday. Some 52 civilians have been wounded. Richardson, who said he met with Kabila several days ago, indicated that the Clinton administration is prepared to help African countries that ""put their ecomomic houses in order"" by granting them access to the US market. He also said that trade and investment initiatives for Africa will be on the agenda when the Group of Seven industrialized countries meet next month in Denver. pg/xb/ok ok","""1997-05-19T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-34M0-0025-F3YX-00000-00"""
./samples/,"He captured the country with barely a battle and was greeted by cheering crowds after each new conquest. Now rebel leader Laurent Kabila faces his biggest challenge: trying to balance promises of democracy with the strong leadership needed to rebuild this neglected nation and hold its more than 250 ethnic groups together. Too many wrong moves could quickly turn the millions who urged him on to label Kabila another dictator, and could cost the rebel chief international support needed to fuel foreign investment, revive the economy and help prepare for elections. The career rebel's biggest threats come from his lack of political experience, and from the support he received from the governments of Uganda and Rwanda to wage his successful campaign against President Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila on Saturday promised to name a transitional government within three days and to introduce a new constitution in 60 days, but he set no date for elections denied for 31 years by Mobutu, and he unilaterally declared himself president. There's a strong argument for Kabila to hold elections as quickly as possible: he's at the peak of popularity for having ousted Mobutu. The longer he waits, the more he risks disenchanting international donors and losing fans among Zaire's nationalistic but ethnically fractious population, which is wary of Kabila's outside support and the ethnic roots of his rebellion. ''We don't know the position of Kabila because of the foreigners behind him,''  said Paul Mdaye, a 26-year-old law student, as he waited for the rebels to march into Kinshasa on Saturday. ''If he tries to work with those Rwandans and Ugandans, he will have big problems,''  Mdaye said. Most of Kabila's original fighters were Banyamulenge, Zairian-born ethnic Tutsis of Rwandan descent who took up arms after Mobutu said they were not true Zairians and tried to expel them. The ethnic makeup of Kabila's army became more diverse as he acquired new territory and recruits, but many Zairians still see it as a Tutsi-led movement that could lead to tribal apartheid in the government and military. Their concerns, and the concerns of the international community, haven't been allayed by the rebels' attitude toward tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees in Zaire. Most of them fled Rwanda in 1994 fearing Tutsi revenge after the Hutu government in power at the time orchestrated the slaughter of about a half-million Tutsis. The United Nations and the now-ousted Mobutu government accused Kabila of trying to avenge the genocide by targeting the Hutus, who had occupied refugee camps along Zaire's eastern borders but were pushed further into Zaire as rebel forces came up behind them. Kabila denies the allegation and accuses the United Nations of incompetence, a sign of his general insouciance toward the international community. Kabila's failure to show up for South African-mediated peace talks in Congo on May 14 a thunderous snub of South African President Nelson Mandela was a striking example of this. So too was Kabila's takeover this month of the national railway, which had been successfully managed by a South African-Belgian-Zairian consortium.

The study prompted extended coverage on television and radio in a country where about 350,000 people suffer from Alzheimer's and wine is part of the national culture. Some 90,000 new cases of Alzheimer's are reported each year. Dr. Jean-Marc Orgogozo, who directed the nine-year project involving almost 4,000 people, said it was too early to advise the elderly to drink wine to fend off senility or Alzheimer's.

./samples/,"Burundi's Tutsi-led army installed its own military ruler Thursday, sealed the borders and ordered civilians off the streets after overthrowing the country's Hutu president. Coup leaders acted to stop ""our people's descent into hell,"" newly installed leader Pierre Buyoya told the country in a nationwide radio broadcast. ""We demand that the international community understand the purpose of our efforts,"" said Buyoya, restored by the coup to a position he lost to a Hutu in a 1993 presidential election. ""What happened today was not a change of regime through ambition, glory or anything else."" ""What happened today was an action of salvation,"" he said. Western leaders condemned the coup, fearing it could bring on ethnic warfare on the scale of neighboring Rwanda's genocide, but said nothing about sending troops to restore President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who headed a Tutsi-Hutu coalition government. Soldiers and police patrolled the central African nation's capital, deserted under army orders to civilians to close businesses and stay at home. Troops shut the airport, and a dozen paratroopers patrolled the state-run TV station, which was surrounded by barbed wire. The coup follows three years of civil war between the country's Hutus and Tutsis that has killed more than 150,000 people. The two-day-old army uprising apparently has been free of violence, although there were reports that the country's main Hutu opposition party would try to lay siege to Bujumbura and Gitega, U.N. Undersecretary-General Chinmaya Gharekhan said in New York. Burundi's ethnic mix - and hatred - is similar to that of Rwanda, where Hutu militia slaughtered a half-million Tutsis and moderate Hutus two summers ago. The Rwandan genocide was prompted in part by Hutus' fears that Tutsis would try to regain the power they held until their monarchy was overthrown in 1959. In Burundi, however, the Tutsis have been in control since the country's independence in 1962. The military coup does not alter the balance of power; no matter who has occupied the presidency, Burundi's Tutsi-run military has always run the country. Burundi, a mountainous country about the size of New Hampshire, lies on the northeast side of Lake Tanganyika and is bordered by Tanzania, Rwanda and Zaire. ""The politicians have failed to solve the problems, and we have decided the country cannot continue like this,"" military spokesman Lt. Col Longin Minani said Thursday. ""Buyoya is more experienced, he is democratic and most people will respect him,"" he said. In a 10-minute address, Buyoya said his first mission as head of a transitional government will be ""to stop - and quickly - the massacres and all kinds of criminality that have been prevailing in Burundi for almost three years."" Ntibantunganya, who took refuge at the U.S. ambassador's residence Tuesday night, has not resigned as leader of the country's fragile coalition government, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Judith Kaula said. ""This is not the worst-case scenario, because it's not your classic bloody coup in the middle of the night,"" she said. At least eight other Hutus, among them three prominent politicians, sought refuge Thursday in the German ambassador's residence. The United States condemned the coup and called on military leaders to resolve the political crisis peacefully. ""We believe now this meets anybody's definition of a coup d'etat because we've now heard directly the intentions of the coup leaders,"" State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Thursday. U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the Organization of African Unity said the international community would not accept a Burundian government installed by force. The Tutsi-led military should ""recognize that a coup d'etat will not solve any of Burundi's problems and is only likely to intensify violence on all sides,"" Boutros-Ghali said in a statement. Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who has tried to broker a peace deal for Burundi, called for sanctions against the new military regime. U.N. officials were working on two contingency plans - one to provide aid if the country collapses in violence and the other to send troops to Burundi to prevent ethnic slaughter. Only Zambia, Malawi and Chad have offered soldiers, however. Tutsi paratroopers surrounded government buildings in the capital late Tuesday, forcing Ntibantunganya (pronounced En-tee-bahn-toon-gan-yah) to flee the palace. Buyoya, who overthrew Jean-Baptiste Bagaza in a 1987 coup, paved the way for Burundi's first free elections. He was defeated in June 1993 by Melchior Ndadaye, who became the nation's first Hutu president. Before Thursday's announcement of Burundi's new president, thousands of youths demonstrated against Buyoya, whom they accuse of fostering political dissent in Burundi. ""Buyoya is the father of disorder,"" one banner said. In Bujumbura, a radio broadcast told people to go home. Military checkpoints were set up on main roads, cutting off the airport, university and suburbs. Streets quickly emptied except for troops and a few playing children. On Burundi Radio, Defense Minister Lt. Col. Firmin Sinzoyiheba warned any additional demonstrations would be punished severely. ""For three years, Burundi was facing a terrible situation where people were dying day after day,"" he said, referring to the ethnic violence sparked by Ndadaye's 1993 assassination by Tutsi army paratroopers four months after he took office. Rwanda accuses the United Nations of standing aside in 1994 as Hutu troops and allied militiamen slaughtered 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis.","""1996-07-25T00:00:00Z""","""3SJ4-JMG0-0006-H45H-00000-00"""

./samples/,"By Milan Dragovic BELGRADE, Dec 4 (AFP) - Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's attempts to stifle independent media reports on mass street protests may backfire as people join the demonstrations to find out for themselves what is going on. Up to 100,000 people have been protesting daily in Belgrade for 16 days over the authorities' refusal to accept election results in which the opposition claimed victory in 15 out of 18 towns and cities, including the capital. ""They treat us like halfwits, depriving us of all information about the demonstrations,"" a Belgrade employee, Branislav Pejcinovic, said. With many of his colleagues, he took part in the protests for the first time on Tuesday and planned to come again on Wednesday. ""It's the only way to keep informed,"" he said. On Tuesday, two independent radio stations which had been giving wide coverage to the protests--B-92 and the students' Radio Index--were declared illegal and shut down. B-92 station boss Veran Matic denounced the move as an ""attempt to provoke even greater destabilisation"" and accused Milosevic of violating human rights. He said the station would seek legal recourse to try to get the decision reversed. For the vast majority of Serbia's 10 million inhabitants, the official radio and television stations are the only sources of information, with the exception of a tiny number who have satellite television. The government-backed press is playing down or ignoring the protests. On Wednesday, after up to 100,000 people turned out on the streets of the capital the day before, the main daily newspaper Politika carried not a single word about the protests, devoting its front page to Zaire, the election of a UN secretary-general and a mining catastrophe in China. A statement from Milosevic's ruling Serbian Socialist Party, saying that the elections were a domestic matter, was hidden away on page 14. ""In the image of all totalitarian regimes, Milosevic's authorities are using the famous rule that what doesn't appear in the press never happened,"" an independent analyst said. However, Serbia's crackdown on the media has drawn international criticism, in particular from the United States, which has made press freedom a condition for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's integration into international institutions. In Brussels, the International Federation of Journalists condemned the closure of the radio stations as an ""act of war on press freedom."" ""In reality, the Milosevic regime has demonstrated clearly what independent journalists have known for years--it is a government of censorship with contempt for press freedom,"" said IFJ Secretary General Aidan White. ""At a time when the people of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia are taking to the streets to reclaim their democratic rights, the government of Milosevic has shown its true colours to the international community. It is fundamental that Western governments respond vigorously,"" he said. Media watchdog Reporters Sans Frontieres (Reporters Without Borders) has also protested. In Belgrade, the independent journalists' association of Serbia on Wednesday demanded the resignation of Serbian Information Minister Aleksandar Tijanic. By stifling the independent press, ""a foolish measure at a time when the demonstrations are the number one issue in the international media, the regime shows its true nature,"" the association said. md/tf AFP","""1996-12-04T00:00:00Z""","""3TDD-TK10-0031-V1XJ-00000-00"""
./samples/,"A summary of top world news today: WASHINGTON - President Bill Clinton defended controversial campaign fund-raising practices Friday, saying he and his subordinates broke no laws and that the fault lay in an ""out of whack''  political system. At a news conference where he was bombarded with questions on the issue, Clinton also said he could not say definitively whether he himself solicited campaign donations by telephone from the White House, a practice that has opened Vice-President Al Gore to criticism. ""I can't say that over all the hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands of phone calls I've made in the past four years, that I never said to anybody while I was talking to them, ""well, we need your help,' or ""I hope you'll help us,'' ' Clinton said. But he stood his ground during an unusually long session of 51 minutes as he was peppered with questions suggesting the White House acted improperly if not illegally in raising millions of dollars for his 1996 re-election campaign. --- KINSHASA, Zaire - Growing support for rebels who are winning territory in eastern Zaire has broken into the open in the capital Kinshasa, as troops intervened Friday to prevent an anti-government march. In New York, the UN Security Council called on the rebels to agree to a ceasefire already accepted by the Zairian government. The rebels, called the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, have so far rejected pressure for a ceasefire. Confident of military victory, they are holding out for a transitional government and elections. With the Tutsi-led rebels advancing in eastern and southern Zaire and meeting little resistance from an undisciplined army, more people in the vast central African country now apparently back guerrilla leader Laurent Kabila. In Kinshasa's sprawling shanty towns, residents openly expressed support for Kabila, whose name has dominated headlines in local newspapers for months. Soldiers in the capital broke up an attempt Friday by the main opposition alliance to march in support of talks with Kabila. Party militants said they would regroup and try again today. --- HONEOYE FALLS, N.Y. - After reading a 1930s book about cloning, a 13-year-old boy took the top prize at his middle school's science fair by creating twin frogs in a petri dish. In fact, he produced three sets of identical frogs. What Tim Cassano accomplished is not cloning, but he did, ""blow everybody away.''  Tim carried off the Best of Show prize Wednesday at his school outside Honeoye Falls, a village south of Rochester, N.Y. Amazed onlookers said college students would have trouble repeating the Grade 8 student's experiment. ""No student here has ever attempted what he's attempted,''  his science teacher, Carolyn Czarnecki, said Friday. ""I'm not putting him on a huge pedestal but . . . it's remarkable for a 13-year-old.''  Basically, he took frog eggs that were fertilized naturally and split them, creating twins.

But Kabila is holding out for a lot more than that, while also resisting American appeals that he agree to yield power quickly after the expected takeover. According to one well-placed U.S. official, the rebel leader has indicated he intends to keep control for up to five years, although he would be willing to hold some legislative elections fairly quickly. The U.S. diplomatic dickering with Kabila and also with ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko is designed to foster a smooth transition to democracy in resources-rich Zaire. Kabila's rebel forces are poised to take the capital, Kinshasa, is a drive the Clinton administration hopes will not be bloody. The approximately 300 American citizens in Zaire are being urged to leave the country and the U.S. embassy has been scaled down. One of the stumbling blocks to a peaceful transition is Mobutu's dignity, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. That is, Mobutu is demanding power be transferred to another Zairian figure, at least on an interim basis. ''He doesn't want to give up to the guy who is defeating him,''  the official said. Meanwhile, the Clinton administration is getting an ambiguous response from Kabila on staging elections. He has told U.S. diplomats there should be a ''period of stabilization''  first, U.S. officials said Thursday. His stance on elections was described as ambiguous. ''We spoke in terms of significant millions of dollars,''  an official told The Associated Press. ''And Kabila wants to remain in power for some time before holding elections.''  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday she was certain Mobutu was looking for a way to yield power to a transitional government. The U.S. hope is that any transitional government, which is expected to include Mobutu and Kabila elements, would move quickly to prepare for elections in Zaire. The has been ruled by Mobutu for 32 years, for most of that time with significant U.S. assistance based on the view that he was a strategic ally of the United States.

Banza, who is also vice-president of the ruling party, said the government wanted to bring the rebels into the national unity government proposed by Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko. ""We have decided to share power--that includes with the rebellion--during the transition,"" he said. The Zairean government resigned Monday but remains the transitional administration. administration. Banza said the party had arrived at the decision because of the need to see through elections.

Banza rejected as ""anti-democratic"" a plan by rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila that the rebels form the transitional government alone. The statement came as the United States and France called for the Zairean government to agree to negotiations with the rebels on the eve of a crucial regional summit in the Togolese capital Lome. Foreign ministers from more than a dozen African countries gathered in the Lome Tuesday to draw up recommendations for Wednesday's Organisation of African Unity summit on the Zairean crisis. The statement by the two western powers, transmitted to 20 African nations, called for ""urgent negotiations to put an end to the conflict in Zaire"" Delegates, observers and the press were expecting the arrival of a delegation of Zaire's rebel alliance which has made spectacular gains in the east of the country and threatened to topple Mobutu's 32-year regime. Kabila had said earlier Tuesday the hundreds of American, French, Belgian and British troops deployed to Brazzaville, Congo, for a possible evacuation of 3,000 foreign nationals was ""a menace to peace"" and an attempt by ""neo-colonialists"" to pressure the rebels. However, in Paris, Congo's President Pascal Lissouba rejected Kabila's charge. ""Congo and Brazzaville are not an integral part of Zaire,"" he said. ""Even if they are at the gates of Zaire, they are in Congo,"" Lissouba said on French radio. The Lome summit is the first occasion the rebels have been invited to an international conference, and is being seen as a test of the importance of the OAU itself. Both the United States and France will have special emmissaries present: Howard Wolpe and Michel Dupuch, respectively. OAU member states have no authority to intervene in the internal affairs of other member states. Mobutu declined the invitation, but will be represented by his advisor, Honore Ngbanda Nzambo, and vice-President Bo Boliko Lokonga. Deputy premier Gerard Kamanda Wa Kamanda has also announced he will be going. The rebels confirmed a delegation was on its way. ""We absolutely must get to negotiations"" Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema told AFP.

Some 14,000 of them had already set up camp seven kilometres (five miles) from the city. bur/rmb/pcj AFP Preliminary peace talks between the Zairean government and rebels aiming to topple President Mobutu Sese Seko will probably be held in South Africa in early April, a rebel spokesman said Tuesday. ""There's a good chance that preparatory meetings will take place in South Africa at the beginning of April,"" the rebels' ""justice minister"" Kongolo Mwenze said.

./samples/,"Soldiers from nine southern Africa armies some of them longtime foes began joint military maneuvers Friday that could lead to the formation of a joint peacekeeping force for African trouble spots. ''We cannot sit back and do nothing when the rest of our continent is sliding to chaos,''  said Gen. Mike Nyambuya of Zimbabwe, head of the maneuvers called Blue Hungwe, or Blue Eagle. Civil war in nearby Zaire, which is feared could send refugees into the relatively peaceful southern sphere of the continent, is just one example of explosive situations which have led to recent calls for an all-African peacekeeping force. The maneuvers, which will consist of 14 days of training and simulated peacekeeping in mountainous eastern Zimbabwe, are ''one of the first steps''  in creating a multinational southern African force to intervene in such conflicts, said Nyambuya. Nyambuya, a veteran of United Nations peacekeeping in Angola and Somalia, said deployment would depend on political decision makers. 'It is only with political authority that we can do what we are practicing here in a real situation,''  he said. Nyambuya said about 1,500 soldiers and support staff from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), an economic and security grouping, were learning how to meld common skills bringing together different military training, command operations and even language. The exercise is the first of its kind in Africa, with the South African military playing a key role outside its own borders for the first time since the nation's democratic elections in 1994. For two decades during the apartheid era, South African troops fought against South African guerrillas based in neighboring countries and waged a destabilization effort against black governments. Numerous sabotage attacks and commando raids were launched against facilities of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress in most of the participating countries Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. Maj. Jacobus Valentine, field commander of 290 South African infantry troops and engineers in Nyanga, said some were veterans of the apartheid government's war in Angola in the mid-1980s. Angola, on the eve of setting up a unity government after years of civil war, has sent observers and civilian police to watch the maneuvers. Nyambuya, addressing an opening parade, told participants ''many of you have tasted combat, sometimes against each other. It is now time to shelve your aggressive tactics and become soldiers of peace.''  The Nyanga maneuvers are taking place in ''Mycosa'', which stands for Mythical Country of Southern Africa, where a fake civil war is raging. British and U.S. officials, French and Danish observers and U.N. humanitarian agencies will assist in replicating an authentic conflict scenario including the movement of refugees, delivery of food aid, the exchange of prisoners and mediating peace. Western donors have said they would finance and provide logistical backing for peace keeping in Africa as long as they do not have to risk the lives of their own troops.

""the new government will take up the challenge left by mobutu's decaying regime to re-build this country which has been crushed to pulp,"" said grattas bugera, general secretary of the alliance of the democratic forces for the liberation of congo-zaire (adfl) chaired by kabila. bugera, kabila's second man, arrived in kinshasa on monday to prepare for kabila's entry. so did kabila's foreign minister bizima karaha, who arrived here this afternoon and was mistaken for kabila himself by some foreign journalists. kabila has promised to hold the general elections in the central africa's largest nation within two years, arguing that the zairean people will have to be senticized about and prepared for democracy first. on may 17, the congo people's liberation army, under the leadership of kabila's adfl, caputured kinshasa, the last ""liberated"" city in the mineral-rich african country. the 3.45-million-square-meter territory of the country fell to the hands of kabila's revolting troops within only seven months. and mobutu, who was in the togolese capital of lome on sunday and monday, is believed to be flown to morocco in exile.","""1997-05-20T00:00:00Z""","""3SP2-F3N0-009B-H0SN-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Zaire's ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel chief Laurent Kabila reached no agreement Sunday on the future of their country, U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun said. Speaking aboard a South African naval vessel on which Mobutu and Kabila met at the Congo port of Pointe-Noire, Sahnoun said the two men would meet again in eight to ten days time with South African President Nelson Mandela. According to a communique issued at the end of the first face-to- face meeting aboard the SAS Outinique, Kabila had proposed that his rebel alliance form a transitional goverment in Kinshasa and Mobutu resign. As a gesture of good will Kabila had ordered his forces to stop their advances on all fronts. That was, however, not a formal ceasefire, noted Mandela, who chaired the meeting. Mobutu had proposed a ceasefire, according to the communique. The proposed transitional government should organise democratic elections in Zaire, Mobutu also said adding that he would resign only after the election of a new president. Mobutu had boarded the SAS Outeniqua Sunday and met Kabila at the negotiating table for the first time, ending two days of on-off specukation about the talks. South African sources had earlier said there had been a proposal for Kabila to head an interim government along with a member of the Zairean opposition, possibly Etienne Chisekedi. Chisekedi had been appointed prime minister by Mobutu in April, but was dismissed three days later because he wanted to include in his government members of Kabila's rebel movement. Kabila's rebels claimed early Sunday to be continuing their advance on Kinshasa. Latest towns to fall were Mayamba and Bankana, leaving the rebels - who already control three-quarters of the vast nation - just 160 kilometres from the capital. The rebels' claim, made over their Voice of the People radio, also said the advance was continuing on Mobutu's luxurious jungle residence on the northern border with the Cnetral African Republic. The radio stressed that the advance was continuing irrespective of what happened at the Kabila-Mobutu meeting, and that ""there can be no question of a ceasefire"". Aid workers meanwhile said the repatriation by air to Rwanda of mainly Hutu refugees from areas of eastern Zaire would continue despite heavy rain. So far 4,000 had been flown home. A spokesman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Paul Stromberg, said that after initial protests the UNHCR now thought it would be possible to comply with rebel demands that the repatriation of some 80,000 Hutus be completed by end of June. On Saturday alone, he said, about 1,000 had been repatriated. But he cautioned that only about half of the estimated 80,000 who fled refugee camps two weeks ago in the face of armed rebel attacks had found their way out of the jungle to assembly camps. The meeting between Kabila and Mobutu was originally planned for Friday. However, Kabila failed to turn up, saying he was concerned about talks security and demanding the United States be excluded. For a time Saturday it was unclear whether talks would ever come about after Kabila snubbed Mobutu Friday, refusing to fly to the ship by helicopter from Luanda while Mobutu and Mandela were on board. Rebel spokesmen in Paris gave yet another explanation Saturday for Kabila's non-attendance. In a statement to a French news agency, they said Mobutu's delegation included witchdoctors and hypnotists who had been assigned to cast spells on Kabila. On Friday, Mobutu's ill health caused almost five hours of delay because he could not climb the 31 metal steps to get aboard the ship. The problem was finally solved by lowering a make-shift ramp over which he was driven by car on board the vessel. According to Zaire's Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda, doctors had advised the cancer-stricken Mobutu against arriving by helicopter as originally planned because the vibrations would be bad for him. The talks between Kabila and Mobutu are seen as the last chance to end the seven-month civil war without any further bloodshed as the rebels close in on Kinshasa. dpa pt","""1997-05-04T00:00:00Z""","""3RPR-R4T0-0094-N4HF-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Burundi's new prime minister said Saturday he hoped to halt international condemnation of the bloodless coup which brought Tutsi strongman Pierre Buyoya to power and caused neighbouring states to slap economic sanctions on the central African nation. Pascal-Firmin Ndimira, a Hutu, Friday unveiled his transitional government which includes ministers from across Burundi's ethnic divide. Ndimira is a member of the Tutsi-dominated Union for National Progress (UPRONA), the main opposition to Hutu president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who remains holed up in the American embassy after the July 25 coup. Ndimira said his new government would make good Buyoya's promise of restoring national unity and saving Burundi from the ethnic violence which has killed tens of thousands of people in the past three years. The line-up includes at least eight ministers from Ntibantunganya's Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU). ""No-one has been forced to join the government,"" Ndimira told Radio Burundi, adding ""dialogue and information is the best formula"" to change the views of countries opposed to the new regime. Seven African nations met on Wednesday in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha and decided to exert ""maximum pressure"" on Bujumbura, including ""the imposition of economic sanctions,"" over the coup. But Tanzania, Zaire, Rwanda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Cameroon are free to decide which sanctions to apply, sources said at the summit. Political observers are divided over whether the new government will be able to prevent genocide like that which killed 500,000 people in neighbouring Rwanda in 1994. Rwanda has a similar ethnic mix to Burundi. Former Tutsi president Jean-Baptiste Bagaza said Saturdy the coup ""will get the country no-where."" And FRODEBU leader Jean Minani, speaking in Nairobi, said the government was ""worthless, both politically and technically. ""It is a government in which only Pierre Buyoya will make decisions, with two or three other people,"" he said. sa-at/jl/js AFP","""1996-08-03T00:00:00Z""","""3TDD-VB90-0031-V41K-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Zairian rebels have threatened to pull out of peace talks scheduled to begin Saturday if the full government delegation does not arrive in South Africa in time. South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun will mediate the talks, scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) in Pretoria, South African Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Peter Swanepoel said Friday. Swanepoel's announcement indicated the talks would begin even though only the head of the Zairian delegation has arrived. Bizima Karaha, the chief rebel negotiator, angrily threatened to pull out of the talks if they do not start Saturday. ''I don't know what we can achieve because the people we are supposed to talk with are not even here,''  Karaha told The Associated Press by telephone. Karaha, who arrived in South Africa late Thursday, said tardiness of the Zairian delegation indicated that Kinshasa was not serious about pursuing peace. ''If the talks don't start tomorrow, we will reassess our position,''  he said. David Whaley, the resident coordinator for U.N. operations in South Africa, said every effort was being made to get the rest of the Zairian delegation to Pretoria in time. ''We will all be on tenterhooks until tomorrow,''  Whaley said. Zaire Embassy Charge d'Affaires Issa Ganda brushed off concerns that the eight remaining government negotiators, including opposition party members, would not arrive on time. ''We had some logistical problems, but they have been resolved,''  Ganda told the AP, adding that they would arrive early Saturday morning. Sahnoun, the U.N. envoy, has said he hopes to get the two sides to agree to a cease-fire. It is not clear if the two sides will meet face to face. One goal could be simply to guarantee further talks. Karaha is the foreign policy adviser to rebel leader Laurent Kabila and represented the rebels at last week's Organization of African Unity summit in Lome, Togo. Honore Ngbanda, who represented President Mobutu Sese Seko at earlier talks in South Africa, flew in Thursday afternoon, then met with Sahnoun briefly, Ganda said Friday. Ngbanda was accompanied by just a few members of his delegation. Mobutu has previously demanded a cease-fire before peace talks, while Kabila has insisted on talks to work out a truce. Now it appears both sides are willing to consider a cease-fire that would take place simultaneously with peace talks. But it was unclear if the initial discussions here would carry enough significance to bring a halt to the rebel advance. Kabila's troops control about a third of the country after a six-month offensive that has met little resistance. They aim to topple Mobutu's 31-year-old dictatorship. The inclusion of opposition parties in the government negotiating team indicated Mobutu was trying to make the talks a broad forum on Zaire's conflict instead of a showdown between his teetering regime and the rebels. But growing conflict between Mobutu's supporters and opposition parties could be ''a complicating factor,''  Whaley said. Mobutu, 66 and ailing with prostate cancer, no longer exercises absolute control. Newly appointed Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, in his first day in office Thursday, offered cabinet posts to the rebels, annulled the constitution and dissolved the 740-member Parliament to establish a transitional government and prepare for the first multi-party elections since Mobutu seized power in 1965. However, Mobutu refused to join in widespread criticism of Tshisekedi, with whom he met privately at his presidential palace in Kinshasa on Friday. ''This is not an affair that concerns the head of state,''  Mobutu said, noting that the constitution bars him from annulling Parliament's decision earlier this week to appoint Tshisekedi. South Africa has a stake in successful peace talks. It wants to establish a firm African role in solving problems on the continent and already has seen a spillover of Zaire's strife into neighboring countries.

./samples/,"Zairean strongman Laurent Kabila was closeted with his aides here Monday on the eve of the announcement of a transitional government to rule this vast and despoliated country after the flight of president Mobutu Sese Seko. There was no immediate word on when Kabila would travel to Kinshasa, but diplomats here said they expected him to wait a few days until his troops were absolutely sure they had secured the capital. Kabila, who proclaimed himself president of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Saturday morning as his troops entered Kinshasa, promised then to set up a government of national salvation within 72 hours. That self-imposed deadline expires around 0930 GMT Tuesday. tuesday. The new regime says the transitional government will be open to opposition politicians in Kinshasa, excluding those who supported Mobutu, but that parties will have no role at this stage. South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who held talks with Kabila in this southern stronghold on Sunday, said afterwards that he was convinced the new government would be broad-based. In the capital, the leader of the radical opposition, Etienne Tshisekedi, known as ""the Sphinx,"" was keeping a low profile Sunday, and not commenting on events, but his principal adviser, Gaston Mukendi, indicated that he would play a waiting game for the time being. ""At the moment it is still a military situation,"" Mukendi told AFP. ""We must wait until things are secure and we will hope to make some contacts....We hope that everyone will now begin to work together."" Roman Catholic Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo, who was named parliamentary speaker in the dying days of the Mobutu regime but did not accept the post, said: ""There are some ideas building but I can say nothing for the moment."" ""We must work as hard as possible for a consensus,"" he added. Observers in Lubumbashi are expecting Kabila to name the nucleus of the government on Tuesday, leaving some posts to be filled later after fuller discussions with politicians who took no part in the seven-month civil war. The government is expected to be formed on the French model, with a strong president but a cabinet presided over by a prime minister. The new regime will also have to fill top civil service posts and name new ambassadors. The pattern in the territories conquered during the war has been to leave most civil servants in place, giving everyone a chance to prove they can adapt to a regime that forbids corruption. Some changes have been made, such as the replacement of the rector at the University of Lubumbashi after agitation by students. The higher ranks of the civil service in Kinshasa are more critical, however, and the new regime is expected to make changes there. Countries around the world were continuing Monday to announce their recognition of Kabila as the new head of state as calm returned to Kinshasa after his troops' virtually unopposed entry there at the weekend. Mobutu was reported to be in Togo, and the leading figures of his government have all fled the country. The country has at least 450 political parties, many of them tiny, and about the same number of tribes, none of them dominant. Kabila has promised the convocation of an assembly within two months to draw up a new constitution. That will be followed by elections expected in around two years, though his regime has given no timetable for them. No census was taken during Mobutu's rapacious 32 years of rule, and estimates of the population of this country, around the size of western Europe, are largely guesswork. The regime will have to issue voting cards before the elections, and also embark on voter education. All real power under Mobutu was in the president's hands, with his 738-member ""transitional"" parliament spending most of its time arguing over trivialities. hn/gd gd","""1997-05-19T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-34T0-0025-F4FP-00000-00"""
./samples/,"President Mobutu Sese Seko has suggested that Parliament form a seven-member team to negotiate with rebels who now control one-third of Zaire. An official in Mobutu's Popular Revolutionary Movement also said the ruling party was prepared to accept a power-sharing agreement with the rebels. But rebel leader Laurent Kabila already has rejected that possibility. ""We say that the...transitional government should be made...only of anti-Mobutists and anti-regime people, who have never been in power and who never shared power,"" Kabila told a weekend rally in Kisangani. At a summit today in Lome, Togo, African leaders and the U.N. secretary-general renewed calls for an immediate cease-fire and peace talks. Officials with the Organization of African Unity, the summit organizers, said they hoped to open the way for negotiations between Mobutu and Kabila, neither of whom attended. Both sent delegations. Mobutu has said for some time he wants negotiations with the rebels. The stumbling block has been whether talks would take place before or after a cease-fire. Kabila insists a cease-fire can only come after, or in conjunction with, talks with Mobutu. At the summit in Togo, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan today repeated his call for a cease-fire. ""It's necessary for everyone to renounce violence and get to the negotiation table,"" Annan said. ""The fighting must stop and dialogue must begin."" Kabila's rebel forces are reported to be less than 60 miles from Lubumbashi, the country's second-largest city. The rebels had long insisted they would only negotiate directly with Mobutu. But they are reported to have softened their stance in recent days. That issue was not raised in a government announcement Tuesday on national television - the first on Mobutu's behalf since he accepted the resignation of his hand-picked prime minister on Monday. Presidential spokesman Kabuya Lumuna Sando said Mobutu would form a national council to advise the government on Zaire's transition to democracy. He gave no other details. ""One is looking for a way to put an end to the hostilities and open negotiations,"" Kabuya said. The announcement disappointed many Zairians, who anticipated Mobutu himself would appear and possibly appoint a new prime minister. ""I swear, it was a non-event, given the buildup of suspense and given the change that all of us were expecting,"" said Yoka Liye Mudaba, spokesman for the national electoral commission. ""I was expecting, at the very least, the terms of negotiations with the alliance. At the most, I was expecting the president to resign - I'm really disappointed,"" he said.

./samples/,"[6] Text of report by Gabonese Africa No 1 radio on 3rd January In Kinshasa, there are talks about division within the [Political] Forces of the Conclave. All is not well within the ranks of the presidential group. The Nationalist United Front, one of the components of Marshal Mobutu's political family, has decided to leave this coalition. From Kinshasa, Kamanda wa Kamanda Mouzembe reports: [Mouzembe - recording] The Zairean Nationalist United Front [Funa] wants to be an autonomous and independent political party during the elections. According to its officials, this new grouping is part of the new Zairean opposition, which will stress the defence of national independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty, legality and love for the fatherland. The members of Funa denounce the lack of sincerity and transparency in the Political Forces of the Conclave, the other name for the presidential group, which is also accused of not respecting the rules of the democratic game. In a press communique, Funa said it had also withdrawn its confidence in and cooperation with the Political Forces of the Conclave. It also announced the forming of its own parliamentary group within the High Council of the Republic - Transitional Parliament. According to unconfirmed sources, this group will be made up of at least 100 councillors of the republic. The straw that broke the camel's back was, and I quote, the press communique, the reappointment of Leon Kengo wa Dondo as head of the transitional government, with the complicity of the Popular Movement of the Revolution [MPR - former sole ruling party] and the Union for the Republic and Democracy, in defiance of the unanimous will of the sovereign Zairean people and of politicians whose expectations have been completely shattered. The formation of Funa is being seen as a piece of defiance to the bipolarization described and certainly as a contribution on the part of Zairean politicians, but also as an action liable to destabilize President Mobutu's political family.","""1997-01-06T00:00:00Z""","""3S4Y-DC70-0017-G25B-00000-00"""
./samples/,"The European Union and Uganda urged Zaire's embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko Tuesday not to fight democratic change in his country, saying Zaire's government must be ready to meet rebel leader Laurent Kabila for talks on Zaire's political future. Speaking to reporters after discussions with European Commission President Jacques Santer and E.U. Development Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Ugandan President Yoweri Musoveni said President Mobutu could no longer stop the forces of political change in Zaire. ""I think the move towards democracy in Zaire is now irresistable,"" the Ugandan President insisted. ""The question is how do you manage that. But, the change itself is coming,"" the president said. Musoveni urged Mobutu to attend peace talks in South Africa, saying that if he could'nt meet Laurent Kabila personally, he must send some ""high-powered people"" to represent him. ""Is he the only one in his goverment? "" Musoveni asked. ""That's a strange government that depends on one person."" E.U. Commissioner Pinheiro said that the focus of international peace efforts must be to prevent ""conflict and bloodshed in Zaire"". Pinheiro urged Mobutu to relinquish his grip on power. ""You've got to ask yourself what is the base of support of the current regime,"" he stressed. "" I think Mr Mobutu will have to enter into power-sharing. He has no option. I'm not sure he was elected so I'm not sure what is his legitimacy,"" he added. The E.U. Commissioner insisted that President Mobutu must ensure that change in his country comes without bloodshed. ""What I think is important is that everyone sits around the table"" Pinheiro said. ""This does not concern one man, it concerns all the people of Zaire."" Pinheiro and other E.U. officials believe that while Mobutu's presence in any future transitional government in Zaire is unacceptable to Kabila and others, there could still be room in Zaire's political future for ""representatives of Mobutism."" ""No major force in Zaire should be excluded from the place in the transitional solution,"" Pinheiro said, adding however that the only ""legitimate power"" in Zaire would be one that arises after elections. dpa si","""1997-04-22T00:00:00Z""","""3RPR-R7X0-0094-N1NY-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Nigeria's military Government charged a Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka, and 11 other dissidents with treason today in connection with a series of bombings of army installations. A playwright who is his country's most celebrated author, Mr. Soyinka is also perhaps Nigeria's most prominent dissident. If he is convicted, Mr. Soyinka could face the death penalty. But because he has lived in exile since he fled Nigeria in November 1994, Mr. Soyinka is unlikely to have to face the full weight of Nigerian law. Taking little comfort from this fact, however, Mr. Soyinka, who has been a relentless critic of military rule in his country since 1965, likened the charges against him to the death sentence the Iranian Government imposed on the British writer Salman Rushdie. The Government of Nigeria's military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, has already drawn strong international condemnation for the November 1995 execution of a prominent author, Ken Saro-Wiwa. ""They haven't got one scintilla of evidence,"" Mr. Soyinka said in a BBC interview from California. ""General Abacha is most comfortable when he's on the murder trail. He's decided he wants to murder the opposition at this time."" Mr. Soyinka maintains homes in New York and London. Charged along with Mr. Soyinka were some of the country's most prominent exiled opposition leaders, including a former army chief, Lieut. Gen. Alani Akinrinade. Eight dissidents who were arrested inside the country, most of them members of the National Democratic Coalition, or Nadeco, had the treason charges read to them in court. The case was adjourned until May 9. Since the beginning of a mysterious bombing campaign that has been aimed at military buses, airports and army installations, the Nigerian Government has caustically denounced Mr. Soyinka, along with what remains of Nigeria's once-vigorous opposition. Although he has never condemned the bombings, Mr. Soyinka has denied any connection with them. The political opposition to General Abacha has been systematically repressed since the military leader seized power in a 1993 coup that followed the annulment of the country's last national elections. Chief Moshood K.O. Abiola, who was widely believed to have won the 1993 vote, has been imprisoned and largely deprived of visitation rights since 1994, when he tried to claim his mandate. A former President, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, was also jailed on nebulous charges of plotting against the Government. Chief Abiola's principal wife, Kudirat, a prominent Government critic in her own right, was gunned down in the streets of Lagos, the nation's commercial capital, last year. No one has been charged in her death. International human rights groups say that thousands of more obscure critics of the Government, from journalists to labor leaders, have been arrested and held without trial or judged in summary fashion. Lately, Nigeria had slowly begun to emerge from the international isolation brought on by Mr. Saro-Wiwa's execution. Moreover, General Abacha's Government has seemed eager to garner further international acceptance by pushing ahead with an electoral schedule that begins this weekend with nationwide municipal elections and is expected to conclude next year with a multi-party presidential vote. Senior Nigerian officials, meanwhile, have begun to insist that their country has a proud record on human rights. ""In comparison to other parts of the world, particularly the developed countries, Nigeria's record on human rights is good if not better,"" the Government's chief secretary, Gidado Idris, told an Organization of African Unity human rights mission that arrived in Nigeria last week to promote respect for human rights. Speculation has been rife in Nigerian news reports in recent weeks that General Abacha intends to run for office himself. In 1993, when Mr. Soyinka urged Nigerians to stop paying taxes to protest the cancellation of election results, the Government seized Mr. Soyinka's passport. He continued to travel on a United Nations passport given to him by Unesco, and eventually slipped out of the country to neighboring Benin while hunting for birds. An avid hunter, Mr. Soyinka once explained how he had managed to arrive in Benin to a journalist who interviewed him at a film festival in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso: ""Just like birds, hunters know no borders.""","""1997-03-13T00:00:00Z""","""3SP8-8W40-000P-N04D-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Retiring chairman Frank Daniels Jr. bid farewell to member publishers and editors of The Associated Press at the news cooperative's annual meeting Monday, ending a five-year term that saw AP innovations in digital photography, advertising technology and online service. In a luncheon address, White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles said he appealed to ""old friends of mine"" to help find work for fallen presidential friend Webster Hubbell because he was taught as a child to help people in trouble. Bowles said he decided to try to help when U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor called him and told him of Hubbell's plight. Heeding his father's advice to lend a hand to friends in need, Bowles said he called three businessmen on Hubbell's behalf. ""They were all old friends of mine,"" Bowles said, adding that Hubbell did not find a job as a result of those calls. Hubbell reportedly got some $400,000 from sympathetic Clinton supporters in 1994. He later pleaded guilty to bilking his Arkansas law firm and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, but his memory lapses have frustrated investigators. The AP meeting and luncheon were attended by executives representing AP's 1,544 daily newspapers. They were the opening events of the first full day of activities of the Newspaper Association of America's convention. Daniels, who has been a member of the AP board of directors since 1983 and chairman since 1992, retired earlier this year as president and publisher of the News & Observer of Raleigh, N.C. ""I believe that AP is in the forefront of innovation - assisting our members without in any way conflicting with them,"" he said. ""Next year we're going to be celebrating our 150 years of existence, and in my judgment, The Associated Press continues to grow and improve each year."" Louis D. Boccardi, AP president and chief executive officer, thanked Daniels. ""He is really a remarkable man and I have learned immensely from him - about business, about the news business, and about human nature. He's cheered our successes and encouraged us to try again when we failed,"" Boccardi said. Also at the meeting, election results from all-mail voting showed that John W. Madigan, chairman, president and chief executive officer of the Tribune Co., and Lissa Walls Vahldiek, vice president and chief operating officer of Southern Newspapers Inc., won seats on the AP's board of directors. Five incumbents were re-elected: John J. Curley, chairman, president and CEO of Gannett Co., representing The News Journal of Wilmington, Del.; Donald E. Newhouse, president of The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J.; Mary Schurz, editor and publisher of The Advocate-Messenger of Danville, Ky.; George W. Wilson, president of the Concord (N.H.) Monitor; and, representing a city under 50,000 population, Gregg K. Jones, co-publisher of The Greeneville (Tenn.) Sun. Boccardi and Newhouse, the chairman-elect, pointed to the success of AP developments such as an online photo archive, AP StocksExpress, a paginated stock service for smaller newspapers, and AdSEND, a digital advertising delivery service. Boccardi also offered a live demonstration of The WIRE, AP's online service for members, which made its debut in October 1996. Those developments notwithstanding, Newhouse said, Daniels will be remembered for his ""special combination of wit and wisdom that are the mark of one of our industry's leading figures."" Boccardi also moderated a panel discussion with AP reporters from around the world about recent developments in Washington politics, the Middle East and ethnic unrest in Africa. Panelists were Nairobi-based newswoman Karin Davies, AP vice president and special correspondent Walter R. Mears, Israel chief of bureau Nicolas Tatro, Washington, D.C., special assignment editor John Solomon and White House reporter Sonya Ross. Davies told the emotionally gripping story of being held last Halloween along with a photographer by government forces in Zaire and told to ""live your last moments. You're going to die."" They were freed hours later. Davies prompted a round of laughter with her story about deciding not to tell her mother that she was covering war-torn Africa. The truth came out after her photographer was wounded and a photo of her cradling the bloody man was printed in her hometown paper, The Seattle Times. A friend called her mother to say her daughter was in the paper, Davies explained, ""And my mother said, 'Oh, at Wimbledon?""' Tatro spoke of the fear of bombings he and his family must endure every day in Jerusalem. He recounted the story of his son asking whether a public bus his class was taking to the zoo would explode. ""I said with more assurance than I felt that it wouldn't,"" Tatro said. ""It leaves everyone with a sense of insecurity about whether to go to the mall or whether to go out to a walk in a crowded place."" Mears, who has traveled with seven presidents, said press access to the president has narrowed steadily over the years, thanks to an ""on-guard sense"" from politicians that comes from every word and action being recorded and dissected for public consumption. Ross said first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is far more accessible on trips than her husband. ""She comes back to the press quarters of the plane to commiserate over the day, to talk about some things that she may have on her mind, to see pictures that photographers took on the laptop,"" she said. ""He is on a larger plane; it's more difficult for him to come back."" Solomon noted that the White House has been unusually vigorous in turning over newsmaking documents related to the controversy over Democratic political fund-raising tactics. The strategy appears to be to release the documents before Republicans uncover them and to inundate Americans with so much information that they become less interested in the controversy, Solomon said. In the board election, Madigan, representing the Chicago Tribune, succeeds Robert H. Hartmann, chairman and publisher of the Evansville (Ind.) Press, who did not seek re-election. Vahldiek, representing The Baytown (Texas) Sun, will serve the last year of Daniels' term. The other directors were elected to three-year terms. Voting was based on membership bonds held by the newspapers that make up the news cooperative. Results of the all-mail voting announced at the meeting: - Wilson, 14,576 bond votes. - Curley, 14,181. - Newhouse, 13,288. - Schurz, 12,843. - Madigan, 12,116. - Vahldiek, 6,747. - Joe Hladky, president and publisher, The Gazette of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 5,712. - W.

./samples/,"By Anthony Morland LOME, March 26 (AFP) - The first international conference to bring Zaire's warring parties together called here Wednesday for talks despite rebels having rejected power-sharing with President Mobutu Sese Seku's regime. Fourteen heads of state as well as delegations from Kinshasa's transitional government and Laurent-Desire Kabila's rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire attended the ceremony that opened the summit, organised by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). It was the first time representatives from Zaire's two warring sides had been in the same room since the civil war began six months ago. ""I urge the parties to move towards the negotiating table,"" United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said. said. The United Nations ""will continue to press the two sides in order that, without further delay, they accept the total cessation of hostilities and commence negotiations,"" he said. The rebels, in control of one-quarter of the country, on Wednesday rejected a government offer to share power. ""We will never, ever enter in any power-sharing arrangement with the government in Kinshasa,"" rebel representative Bizima Karaha, who is in the Togolese capital, for the summit told the BBC. ""One thing for sure, we are not fighting for power sharing, we are fighting for democracy, for freedom, we are fighting for human rights' respect, we are fighting for a united country,"" he said. The rebels are also fighting for the great wealth of the central African country. Their advance into the southeastern heartlands of Zaire, containing the world's biggest reserves of cobalt, has sent tremors through importers in key London markets. In interviews in Kinshasa on Tuesday, Zairean Vice-premier Banza Mukalay, who is also vice-president of the ruling Zairean party, said the government wanted to bring the rebels into a national unity government proposed by Mobutu. ""We have decided to share power--that includes with the rebellion--during the transition,"" he told reporters. The Zairean government of Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo resigned Monday but will continue in office until a new government can be put in place. Annan said the United Nations and the OAU were ""working within a joint framework for peace: the comprehensive five-point plan endorsed by the Security Council."" As well as negotiations and a ceasefire, this plan calls for the protection of refugees and displaced people, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Zaire, respect of the country's sovereignty and integrity as well as for the convening of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region. ""We must keep human rights issues at the forefront of our considerations. Atrocities should be investigated,"" Annan added. OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmad Salim appealed ""to both parties to rise to the occasion of the hour."" ""I have high expectations that this summit will provide a framework for a speedy solution to the crisis in Zaire,"" he said. Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema used an African proverb to warn of the dangers of ignoring the crisis in the Great Lakes region. ""If your neighbour's hut begins to burn, one should put out the fire lest it spread to your own hut,"" he said. Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said ""The people of Zaire are anxious that this summit will come up with recommendations for a lasting solution to their problems."" ""All diplomatic efforts should be intensified"" to achieve this, he said. Presidents of Burundi, Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo (hosting) Zambia and Zimbabwe attended the summit, as did South Africa's vice-president and Algeria's prime minister. Before the lavish opening ceremony one of the two men representing the alliance here said the summit could lead to negotiations with Kinshasa.

./samples/,"Zaire's embattled, ailing president met face-to-face Sunday with the rival who has overrun nearly three-fourths of his country - but all they agreed on was to hold another meeting. President Mobutu Sese Seko did not announce his resignation, as had been expected. U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun said that rebel leader Laurent Kabila had agreed to a temporary cease-fire as a ""gesture of good will"" before the meeting, but it was not clear whether the truce continued or indeed if it ever took place. ""As a gesture of good will he has ordered his troops to stop their advance on all fronts,"" Sahnoun said, reading from a prepared statement. ""They would, however, defend themselves and reciprocate if they were attacked."" Kabila's rebels, who already control three-quarters of Zaire, reportedly are pushing toward the capital, Kinshasa. Kabila's forces claimed Saturday to have taken control of Kenge, the last major town on the way to the capital, only 115 miles to the west. Rebels also took Lisala, Mobutu's birthplace, about 150 miles south of the president's hometown of Gbadolite, a rebel officer said. During a news conference with a grim-faced Mobutu and smiling Kabila, Sahnoun told reporters aboard a South African naval ship that South African President Mandela, who was helping to mediate the talks, would reconvene another meeting between the two rivals within six to 10 days to narrow the gap between them. Sahnoun told reporters that Mobutu had proposed a cease-fire and the creation of a transitional government that would prepare the Central African nation for its first multiparty elections. Mobutu said he would hand over power to such an elected president. But Kabila, according to the statement read by Sahnoun, is demanding that the rebel alliance be allowed to take over power as the transitional authority and that Mobutu cede power to them. Mobutu left the ship without making any comment to reporters and was expected to fly back to Kinshasa later in the day. Kabila was en route to Angola. Mandela emphasized that a permanent cease-fire had not been agreed to by Kabila. ""The question of a cease-fire is not part of his vocabulary,"" he said. ""What he is concerned with is that negotiations will led to the end of hostilities."" Kabila said Friday he would go to the talks only to secure ""Mobutu's exit and the handover of power to the alliance."" Otherwise, he said, rebel forces would take the rest of Zaire within two weeks. Mobutu has insisted he never would bow to Kabila's demand to resign, but his illness and international pressure may force him to do so. Sources close to the talks had said that mediators were seeking an agreement in which Mobutu would step down for health reasons and appoint an interim president until elections could be held. This would allow Kabila and his forces to peacefully enter Kinshasa. Wearing his signature leopard-skin cap and looking grim, Mobutu boarded the ship early Sunday. Supported by a cane in one hand and his wife on the other, the ailing president was met by the South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister Joe Modise. Kabila was flown to the ship from Angola late Saturday night, a day after he balked at attending the negotiations, citing security concerns. A White House official, responding to reports that U.S. envoy Bill Richardson was carrying a letter from Mobutu to President Clinton saying that he would step down, said Saturday, ""I would not read it that way."" Mobutu did send a letter to the United States last week in which he committed himself to negotiations with the rebels, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity Saturday. A U.S. official in Kinshasa said nine Americans - non-essential staff and dependants of embassy employees - left the city on Saturday as a ""precautionary measure"" because of the confusion surrounding the peace talks. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Americans took a ferry to neighboring Congo. Thirty-eight Americans remain at the embassy, including Ambassador Daniel Simpson.

./samples/,"Rebel leader Laurent Kabila announced Friday he would not attend peace talks with the ailing Zairian president until officials could guarantee his security. Kabila, speaking to reports Friday night in the Angolan capital of Luanda, said he would attend talks aboard a South African vessel on Saturday only after security forces assured him of his safety. Kabila complained that South African officials had concerned themselves only with Mobutu's safety. He said South African officials would be presenting him with a security report Saturday and that he would determine whether to meet President Mobutu Sese Seko. Furthermore, the rebel leader claimed, he wasn't even issued a formal invitation to the talks. ''I wasn't invited,''  Kabila said. ''I heard it on the radio, but I got no official invitation.''  Kabila's apparent stalling tactic came a day after Mobutu himself hedged on attending the summit, failing to show up at the airport for a flight to the talks. Zairian officials Thursday blamed the delay on logistical problems. Mobutu grudgingly flew to Congo and boarded the South African naval ship on Friday and the SAS Outeniqua set sail for international waters off of Angola. South African President Nelson Mandela and other officials were on board the ship to preside over the talks. South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who was supposed to escort Kabila from Angola to the talks, flew to the ship Friday night carrying a message from Kabila. The ship later returned to the Congo port. The international diplomats who have brokered the peace talks, the first face-to-face showdown between the two rivals, know the summit may be the last chance to prevent the rebels from taking the capital. Rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire are only 400 kilometers (250 miles) from Kinshasa and have said they will storm the capital if Mobutu does not step down. Kabila said Friday night that he would go to the talks only to negotiate ''Mobutu's exit and the handover of power to the Alliance.''  Otherwise, he said, rebel forces would take the rest of Zaire within two weeks. Kabila claimed that Zairian government forces had been reduced to 11 percent of their original strength. He also said accusations of rebel atrocities against some of the 80,000 Rwandan refugees in central Zaire were ''a political setup to prevent the Alliance rising to full power and to tarnish my character.''  U.N. investigators in Geneva said Friday they would leave this weekend to check into alleged massacres of the the Rwandan Hutu refugees by the rebels, even though the rebels have so far refused to permit the visit. U.N. officials said the rebels had held up approval because Roberto Garreton of Chile would be one of the investigators. He has reported to the U.N. Human Rights Commission that that he marked 40 locations in rebel-held eastern Zaire where he believed there were mass graves. He cited accounts of graves containing anywhere from a few hundred to 50,000 corpses, but said he had no idea of the true number of victims. Earlier in the day, officials gathered in this port city were uncertain up to the last minute whether Mobutu would board the SAS Outeniqua. The ailing president had refused to take a helicopter to the boat, saying the vibrations would be bad for his cancer-ridden body. Five hours later, a plank was lowered from the ship and Mobutu was driven aboard a side portal of the naval vessel. When asked whether Mobutu was there to announce he would step down from his nearly 32 years in power, Mobutu's chief of staff Felix Vunduwe, said, ''No. Why should he?''  ''They have come to obtain a cease-fire and to obtain a precise framework for negotiations about the transition process,''  Vunduwe said. The ship set sail into the Atlantic Ocean, headed toward Angola, at about 5:20 p.m. (1620 GMT). U.S. envoy Bill Richardson, who has been in the region since Monday helping to broker the peace talks, said before boarding the ship Friday that ''the main elements of any agreement will be dealt with by the Zairians themselves.''  ''In my view, this meeting will produce a process that involves a transfer of power and hopefully a transitional, inclusive government,''  added Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Mandela was also optimistic about the talks. ''I am confident the two leaders realize the importance of a peaceful settlement,''  he said. ''I know few leaders who have made military gains and nevertheless been committed to peace as Mr. Kabila has.''  The talks were to be held in a windowless, air-conditioned container aboard the ship, presided over by Mandela and U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun. Mobutu, 66, has insisted he would never bow to Kabila's demand to resign, but he is seriously ill with prostate cancer and the international pressure to step down may force him to do so. The United States and other countries want a cease-fire in Zaire's civil war, the establishment of a transitional government that includes rebels and opposition parties, and a plan for free, fair elections.

./samples/,"PRESIDENT Mobutu Sese Seko could little have imagined that the seeds of his downfall were sown when an old friend was murdered three years ago. The longest-serving of Africa's despots had been in power since Lyndon B. Johnson was in the White House. Through the decades, Mr Mobutu astutely played on the American obsession with communism, the West's skewed perceptions of Africa and the willingness of his potential rivals to sell their souls. Even when he came under pressure from old allies to get in step with post-cold -war ideology and hold elections, Mr Mobutu more than had the measure of his opponents at home. Just one year ago he had every reason to believe he could massage the vote and hold on to power. But a time bomb had been set ticking with the death of the little-known president of Rwanda, an obscure nation on Zaire's border, in 1994. And when the explosion eventually came seven months ago with the start of civil war, it drove the chickens home to roost. A journalist-turned-soldier, Joseph-Desire Mobutu, was an early player in shaping the former Belgian Congo. Within five days of liberation in 1960, the country was plunged into crisis with an army mutiny, secessionist rebellions and a power struggle between President Joseph Kasavubu and the radical prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. Three months later, Colonel Mobutu led his first coup. The following year - after Lumumba's murder by Katangan secessionist rebels and with his followers continuing an uprising in the east - Mr Mobutu unexpectedly returned power to the civilians. His initial hesitancy to use force to put down Katangan secession led some at the time to believe he lacked the authority and ambition for leadership. Mr Mobutu did not hesitate a second time when in 1965 the national assembly fractured along ethnic and regional lines. He declared himself president of the Second Republic and banned all political parties. His contempt for the self-serving politicians of the time never diminished during three decades of rule. Marshal Mobutu, as he became, sowed the seeds of what was then called Congo's destruction under the cover of asserting its independence and identity. The ""authenticity"" campaign, which encouraged people to rediscover their African roots, and the ""Zaireanation"" process of seizing foreign-owned firms, captured the imagination of many of Mr Mobutu's compatriots who had lived as second-class citizens in their own land under colonial rule. The campaigns were frauds. The nationalisation of industries and plantations was an excuse to plunder. Once profitable firms ended up in the hands of Mr Mobutu and his cronies, many were driven into the ground. Even the re-naming of the country as Zaire was camouflage for the sense of inferiority felt by a man who came from the marginalised Ngbandi people, not the larger Kongo. Under the authenticity campaign, he even changed his own name to the vainglorious Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga: the all-powerful warrior who will go from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake. It was all a myth. Far from asserting Zaire's independence, he sold it to the West. The real conquest was of the Zairean people who were ground into poverty by a regime for which the word kleptocracy was coined. Mr Mobutu's Popular Revolutionary Movement (MPR) supplanted the old state. It controlled every aspect of administration and sucked state firms dry. Mr Mobutu used the MPR to shuffle political and military positions constantly to ensure no one came close to challenging his power. The party provided the mechanism under which he was elected unopposed to the presidency three times. To the West, and particularly the United States, none of this mattered. Mr Mobutu could plunder and oppress as he liked as long as he stayed loyal to the anti-communist cause. When Angola went Marxist in 1975, Zaire's leader opened crucial routes for covert US aid to Unita rebels. And Mr Mobutu was always to hand when France wanted approval for its neo-colonial excursions into Chad and other African countries. He was rewarded with military assistance any time he needed to put down a threat to his rule. Even when the world started changing around him, Mr Mobutu was defiant. Under pressure from his old allies as the cold war ended to open up Zaire to democracy and free market economics, he blustered that anyone who felt strong enough to kick him out should come and try. Yet he was also pragmatic. In April 1990 he legalised multi-party politics and announced a transitional government while a new constitution was hammered out ahead of elections. Perhaps Mr Mobutu was driven by his contempt for politicians. He had good reason. He outwitted and outmanoeuvred them, tying the transition process up in knots by buying off opponents and funding dozens of political parties among the 450 which registered. He left the chaotic 700-member transitional parliament to squabble itself into paralysis while he retained control of the army and key areas of government, and continued to bleed the country dry. He let loose the army in bouts of mass looting across the country in 1991, and again two years later. Parliament threatened to impeach Mr Mobutu. He fired back a threat to have the prime minister tried for high treason. Nothing came of either threat, revealing the old dictator's continuing power. By the time the civil war began in October, the ""transition"" had been taking place for almost seven years. Who knew if there would ever really be an election, but if it came about there was every chance Mr Mobutu would win it. Through the transition years he had become further estranged from his erstwhile allies. The shooting down of several hundred students, the army's mass looting and the heavy-handed use of troops to intimidate parliament cost Zaire aid and its president visas to the US, Belgium and his favourite French Riviera palace. The 1994 Rwandan war and genocide changed all that. When the Rwandan president, Juvenal Habyarimana, and his plane were blown from the sky, Mr Mobutu mourned the loss of a close ally and friend. He blamed the Tutsi-led rebel army - although it undoubtedly was not responsible for the murder - and threw his support behind Hutu extremists. The Rwandan refugee crisis opened the doors to the West once again. But Mr Mobutu had made the gravest misjudgment of his long rule. In allowing Hutu mass murderers to regroup inside the refugee camps in Zaire, he misunderstood the determination of the new Rwandan government. After genocide, and with a large, hostile neighbour on its border, the tiny country had become Africa's Israel. It struck back with a vengeance by organising the rebellion which has swept to the gates of Kinshasa. Mr Mobutu, already suffering from prostate cancer, was powerless to respond. He began to pay the price for years of abuse and neglect of his country. The army he had reduced to an undisciplined mob led by an organised crime syndicate proved unable and unwilling to fight. The decrepit state of roads, communications and other infrastructure hindered what little effort the government made at resistance. The treasury's empty coffers left the army scrabbling around for the means to buy weapons. Above all, he had alienated an entire nation. Mr Mobutu was right, Rwanda had invaded Zaire. But as the rebellion gained momentum, Zaireans cared little about who was behind it so long as it disposed of their president. It is, perhaps, the greatest testament against him. Zaire's leader did not lay the groundwork for a succession. No one else was ever allowed to gain such power. But the war and Mr Mobutu's illness offered Zaire a period in which to adjust to change. Had the old autocrat died suddenly with no formal transition in place, there was every chance that the same clique which has robbed Zaire of its potential would have perpetuated its power by one means or another. The war has changed all that. Now there can be no passing of the baton to the old guard. If nothing else, the rebels have ensured that Mobutuism is dead.","""1997-05-17T00:00:00Z""","""3TDG-VPB0-006X-B1RS-00000-00"""

./samples/,"Zairian opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi says he is the new prime minister of Zaire, and that President Mobutu Sese Seko has given him permission to form a government. Tshisekedi met Thursday at Mobutu's Riviera villa for the first time since the Zairian leader ousted him as prime minister four years ago. The two had been political archenemies, but Tshisekedi said after their meeting that they had reconciled to solve their country's problems. In an interview conducted Thursday night and broadcast Friday on Radio France International, Tshisekedi was asked if, since the meeting, he considers himself prime minister. ''Absolutely,''  Tshisekedi replied. Asked if Mobutu explicitly had given him the OK, he said, ''That's obvious. It comes from this national reconciliation we have had.''  In Kinshasa, the Zairian capital, Mobutu's special counsel Ngbanda Nzambo denied the claim and said Leon Kengo wa Donda remains prime minister. Exiled from Kinshasa by Mobutu in the 1980s, Tshisekedi was elected prime minister by the transitional National Conference in August 1992. But Mobutu refused to confirm him to office. Mobutu is convalescing at his villa in southern France after prostate cancer surgery in Switzerland in August. ''During a certain time President Mobutu said, 'I don't want to cohabit with Mr. Tshisekedi,'...but now, he doesn't oppose this any more,''  the opposition leader said in the radio interview. ''Thus he will respect the constitutional act by which I will direct the government that we call the National Unity government.''  Asked about the fate of Kengo, Tshisekedi replied: ''He was the prime minister of the Westerners, not the prime minister of the Zairian people.''  He declined to elaborate on whether Kengo would now have to go, telling his interviewer to ''draw the logical conclusions from what I have said.''  He added that upon his return to Kinshasa he would ''hold the necessary consultations''  to create a national unity government. Asked if Mobutu had informed Kengo he would no longer be prime minister, Tshisekedi replied: ''I am not the president. Mobutu can respond to your question.''  He said the problems in eastern Zaire, where fighting between Tutsi-led rebels and Zairian troops has killed thousands of people and scattered a million refugees, must be solved by negotiations. ''I think we have sufficiently shed the blood of our people that we cannot permit ourselves to shed one more drop of Zairian blood,''  he said. Although Tshisekedi has not announced his candidacy, he is expected to run for president if elections are held as scheduled in May, as Kengo said Thursday they would be. Mobutu, who has canceled elections twice since promising a transition to democracy in 1990, was before his illness also expected to run.

Now they must govern the territory they have captured. Life in the major towns in the region Goma, Bukavu and Uvira _ is returning to normal. Markets are crowded again, businesses are open and farmers are bringing produce in to sell in the towns. In Goma, four weeks after the rebels seized the town of several hundred thousand at the north end of Lake Kivu, a sense of optimism is growing. The rebels are pumping water to homes for at least part of the day, and electricity should be restored soon. The border with Rwanda has reopened, and the town's only industry, a cigarette factory, has been resupplied from Kenya and is to reopen soon. ''Before you couldn't walk down the street with dlrs 100 in your pocket, someone from the army or the police would steal it from you,''  said resident Norbert Shuku. ''Now it is not a problem.''  Today there are far fewer armed men in the wide, rutted streets than before the rebellion erupted in mid-October. But the troops are mostly Tutsis in a region where they are a minority, causing some resentment. ''Lots of people ask what these Tutsi people are doing here,''  said Shuku. ''But I think that will change when they finish training the local people, and we see our own men in the army.''  Ethnic Tutsis and Hutus both moved into the area around Goma in the 1920s, living alongside the indigenous people like the Nandes and the Hundes. Laurent Kabila, the leader of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for Liberation, is not a Tutsi, but he built up a rebel army with local Tutsis who had been hounded by the Zairian army. By all accounts, he also received help from the Tutsi-controlled governments in Rwanda and Burundi. ''We are fighting for all the people of Zaire to overthrow the corrupt regime of (President) Mobutu Sese Seko,''  Kabila said. ''We demand a new transitional government and fair democratic elections.''  The rebels claim to control a 340-mile (550-kilometer) -wide north-south strip along Zaire's borders with Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, and a wedge of territory 300 miles (480 kilometers) wide from Goma to Kisangani, a Zaire River port they are preparing to capture. They also claim to hold Kindu, 200 miles (320 kilometers) west of the Rwandan border. In the territory he holds, Kabila has been careful to appoint local people to key political posts. But many are inexperienced and there are growing pains. He has also let Mobutu's intelligence officers and soldiers keep their jobs in return for their allegiance. Civil servants have been permitted to return to their jobs, but on condition they do not demand bribes. Rebel commander Andre Kassesse told a rally that any government worker demanding a bribe should be reported to his office. Kabila, a long-time foe of Mobutu, has proclaimed his intention to reform the Zairian government and install a free-market economy. He added that he wants a system in which Zaire's vast mineral wealth benefits its people, who are among the poorest in the world. But unlike previous anti-government movements, rebels say they do not intend to seize mineral concessions held by foreign companies. ''Those companies will be able to operate as normal, just as long they pay their taxes to us, the taxation will not affect their operations,''  said Jean Kabongo, a senior adviser to Kabila. ''We do not want them to leave, we need them to operate the mines.''  Some mines have already fallen under rebel control, Kabongo said, citing the diamond mines around Kindu and Mobutu's personal gold mine near Bunia, near the Ugandan border. ''This a very, very rich country. There is no reason the people should be this poor,''  Kabongo said. ''We must stop the thieves in Mobutu's regime who are stealing everything for themselves.''  Mobutu, who seized power in 1964 following four years of chaos after independence from Belgium, changed the name of the country from Congo to Zaire in 1971. He said the change was necessary to erase the brutal and primitive image the name Congo evoked in the minds of foreigners. Now, the rebel alliance wants to change the name back. ''The word Zaire means nothing in any of our languages. This is the Congo, the river is the Congo, this nation should be the Democratic Congo,''  Kabongo said.

./samples/,"The United States hopes rebel leader Laurent Kabila will avoid bloodshed when his forces make their expected triumphal entry into Zaire's capital. But no one here is sure of that. Kabila is avoiding a direct reply to American entreaties, including those from U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson. So, for insurance purposes, the United States is hoping for another round of South African-sponsored negotiations between President Mobutu Sese Seko and Kabila, the likely next leader of the central African country. Their first meeting was inconclusive. Mobutu, ailing with prostate cancer, subsequently went to a regional summit meeting in Libreville, Gabon, and he may be gone from Zaire for good. ""We don't know if the president will be returning to Kinshasa,"" Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said Thursday. ""This is a decision he, alone, can make."" The rebel forces, meanwhile, advanced on the capital, but did not enter. ""The president has no intention of resigning or going into exile,"" Kambala Mututulo, the mining minister, was quoted as saying. ""This is his country. He will not be forced out."" Unquestionably, the United States wants him out. There is no fuss being made, at the moment, over the enormous assets Mobutu, for a long time with U.S. backing, was able to accumulate over 32 years in power. Richardson, meanwhile, reported on his talks to officials in France, which has influence in central Africa, and headed home. That left the next U.S. step a question mark. But lacking a commitment from Kabila not to inflict bloodshed on civilians, the United States is still pushing for negotiations to form a transitional government - one that presumably would include Mobutu ministers. The hope is that that will lead to elections and a free-market economy in Zaire. But what about Kabila? American officials this week tried to take comfort in statements they said they had seen in which he affirmed an interest in democracy and capitalism. Burns said Thursday these were the U.S. objectives in Zaire, a large country with rich resources: ""First of all, end the fighting, achieve a cease-fire; second, to ensure respect for human rights, the human rights of the citizens of Zaire; and third, to try to promote, along with South Africa and the United Nations and others, a peaceful transition."" The U.S. spokesman went on: ""There's no question that that transition is under way, with the continued march towards Kinshasa of the rebel alliance. That alliance military victory seems likely in the coming days. But the future of Zaire is at risk."" The United States has faulted Kabila for the way refugees in and around Kisangani were treated. In return, the rebel leader offered assurances they would be well-treated. The test, Burns said, ""is to make sure that the actions as well as the words of the rebel alliance meet a basic international standard and, we would submit, a standard that the Zairean people would also want to have for their own government....

Richardson ""will press both sides to agree to halt the fighting and launch serious negotiations to form an inclusive transitional government leading to free and fair democratic elections,"" White House spoksman Michael McCurry said Saturday. In the most recent in a series of successful foreign missions before his UN posting, Richardson won the release of an American and two other aid workers from a rebel group in Sudan. The trip came only two weeks after his visit to North Korea where he negotiated the return of Evan Carl Hunziker, a 26-year-old American missionary detained for three months and charged with spying. ""I've been called the undersecretary for thugs. I guess that's accurate,"" Richardson said in an interview with AFP. He honed his diplomatic skills, he said, back home in New Mexico, dealing with the southwestern state's many competing Indian tribes and ethnically mixed population. There, he learned to listen and find common ground. Richardson was born November 15, 1947, in California.

./samples/,"A summary of top world news Friday: JERUSALEM (CP) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, apparently fearing his right-wing coalition partners could scuttle the peace process, said he is considering bringing the opposition Labor party into his government. Speaking from Rome, the prime minister told Israeli broadcasters he is seeking ""national consensus''  ahead of negotiations on a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians. The final talks will address some of the most sensitive issues between the two sides, including Jerusalem's status and the future of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. ""We are talking about the most fateful negotiations in the history of the state. . . . Though it may have public support, it doesn't mean that it will gain support in the Knesset (parliament), and that question is what's guiding me,''  Netanyahu told Channel 2. Netanyahu said he has already spoken to cabinet ministers about what he called a unity government with Labor, which oversaw the first Israeli-Palestinian peace accords when it was in power in the early 1990s. --- KINSHASA - Zaire's strongman Mobutu Sese Seko began counting down a deadline to quit as the prime minister announced a government with top army generals in charge of the defence and interior ministries. Gen. Likulia Bolongo, the man Mobutu appointed Wednesday as prime minister, named a 28-member national salvation government on Friday. The army chief of staff, Gen. Mahele Lieko Bokungo, is the new defence minister, and Gen. Ilunga Shamanga is the interior minister. Rebels who control half of Zaire including its economic heartland have paused in their advance in the sprawling Central African country. They have given the ailing Zairian president until the weekend to signal a willingness to quit. In Geneva, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan urged the rebels and government to return to the negotiating table. On the humanitarian front, the United Nations said it flew 240 displaced Zairians to the eastern border town of Goma in a test run for the repatriation of as many as 100,000 Rwandan refugees. --- FARGO, N.D. - People of the northern plains heard that floods could persist for weeks as the slow-motion disaster put a strain on temporary flood barriers and on emotions. Far downriver in Manitoba, people have been told to brace for what could be one of the worst floods in memory. Capt. Pat Richards of North Dakota's emergency management division said: ""We're looking at a slow, continuous melt. ""We've been warning people that a lot of reservoirs will have to put out water, so those river levels will likely stay up for quite some time. ""There's so much water that still lies south of Fargo the river will probably be in flood stage at least two to three weeks,''  said Donald Schwert, a geologist at North Dakota State University. The week of cold weather had saved a lot of property by postponing the melting. Fargo is about 280 kilometres from the Manitoba border, and people in the province were warned Thursday that flooding might force them to leave their homes some time this spring.

President Mobutu Sese Seko's failure Thursday to show up for a flight for talks with rebel leader Laurent Kabila had left the status of peace negotiations unclear. There appeared to be confusion over the venue for the talks, with the staging point changing from Gabon to Congo Thursday. But Mandela appeared confident the talks would go on. ''If I was not optimistic I wouldn't be going there,''  Mandela told reporters at Waterkloof Air Force Base before departing for Congo early Friday. Mandela was scheduled to meet Mobutu in this port city, where he will accompany him to the South African naval ship, the SAS Outeniqua. The Outeniqua will move out to international waters for the first face-to-face talks between Mobutu and Kabila. The talks will be presided over by Mandela and U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun. ''I am convinced personally that both of them do want a settlement. There is not a clash in so far as they want Zaire to speak with one voice on almost all the issues affecting that country,''  Mandela said. South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki left Thursday for Luanda, Angola, where he was expected to meet Kabila and accompany him to the talks, said his spokesman Ricky Naidoo. A rebel spokesman Thursday, however, said talks would not get under way until Sunday. ''The end of the war will be on Sunday when Mobutu decides to leave,''  spokesman Bizima Karaha told reporters in the southern, rebel-held city of Lubumbashi. Mobutu, 66, has insisted he would never bow to Kabila's demand to resign, but he is ill with prostate cancer and under intense international pressure to step down. The United States and other countries want a cease-fire in Zaire's civil war, the establishment of a transitional government that includes rebels and opposition parties, and a plan for free, fair elections. An American diamond miner in Lubumbashi, meanwhile, said troops from Angola as well as Angolan tanks and heavy equipment were involved in the rebel push toward the capital. The United States has warned Angola not to get involved in the conflict in Zaire. Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was in the Angolan capital of Luanda to discuss the issue Thursday. A U.S. State Department official in Washington confirmed the miner's report, and said Angola is also massing troops in its Cabinda region, which is within striking distance of Kinshasa.

Richardson was expected to meet with the ailing president on Tuesday and then possibly travel to the eastern city of Kisangani to meet with rebel leader Laurent Kabila. The White House announced Saturday that Richardson would meet with the rival factions in an effort to get relief supplies to some 100,000 Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire. ''He will press both sides to agree to halt the fighting and to launch serious negotiations to form an inclusive transitional government leading to free and full democratic elections,''  said White House press secretary Mike McCurry. ''During the mission, Ambassador Richardson will also underscore the deep concern of the United States regarding the humanitarian situation, refugee repatriation and human right in Zaire,''  McCurry said. Since October, Kabila's forces have seized half of the Central African country. Efforts in recent weeks to arrange a meeting between Kabila and Mobutu have failed, though officials close to the negotiations say talks between the two men could take place this week in neighboring Gabon.

With trouble simmering in Bosnia, the Middle East, North Korea and central Africa, the president declared that his new foreign policy team would ''make sure that...America remains the indispensable nation the world's greatest force for peace.''  BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) Slobodan Milosevic permitted a small radio station that symbolizes the struggle for civic freedoms to go back on the air Thursday as he sought to defuse the biggest protests ever against him. There were other signs the Serbian president was trying to take the steam out of the opposition's protests. On Thursday, the 17th consecutive day of protests, 100,000 demonstrators came out on the streets of Belgrade to decry the annulment of Nov. 17 local elections won by the opposition. The head of Belgrade's election commission told BK television he would appeal to the Supreme Court to uphold the original election results. In another attempt at appeasing the protesters, the government said it would make good on late pension payments and provide student loans and grants. DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) Encouraged by the peaceful welcome that Rwanda has given refugees returning from Zaire, Tanzania and the United Nations said Thursday they would start sending home the half-million Rwandan refugees here. The return from Tanzania would all but eliminate the need for a proposed, Canadian-led international military mission on behalf of refugees, Canada's defense minister said in Ottawa. Tanzania has assured the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees of its commitment to carrying out the repatriation in an orderly and humane manner.

./samples/,"In the first public admission that Mobutu Sese Seko is losing his hold on a country ripped by civil war, his spokesmen said that the longtime dictator is willing to negotiate an end to the fighting and share power with the rebels. Speaking on national television tonight, Mr. Mobutu's spokesman, Kabuya Lumuna Sando, said that Mr. Mobutu has formed a negotiating team with full power to represent him and has called on the Parliament to nominate a Prime Minister and form a transitional government. And the second-ranking official in Mr. Mobutu's party, Banza Mukalay, also said tonight, ""We have decided to share power, including with the rebellion, during a transition period."" But political specialists here said that Mr. Mobutu, who has managed to outmaneuver his opponents since his supreme rule was challenged in 1991, may be simply trying to buy himself more time in what looks like an increasingly doomed effort to cling to power. ""This is clearly a preparatory step,"" said a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Mobutu knows that his days are numbered, and he is trying to prolong them."" The rebel alliance, which already controls the eastern third of the country and is poised to take Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city, rejected Mr. Mobutu's overture and warned that it would treat as an enemy anyone who accepted the post of Prime Minister in a Mobutu Government.. On Sunday, Mr. Mobutu made his first public appearance and promised that in the next 48 hours he would have a plan to stop the rebels' attempt to overthrow his government. The rebels, known as the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, have rejected international pressure for a cease-fire and confidently proclaimed that they will win the war by marching into this sprawling capital city by June. The rebels are said to be about 100 miles from Lubumbashi. While, it is clear to almost everyone that the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, will win the war, he faces a greater political fight whenever he invades this capital city. Mr. Kabila has announced that he would not let any existing political party participate in a transitional government. Mr. Kabila's move to exclude opposition leaders, particularly Etienne Tshisekedi, from the Government, does not sit well with people here. While Mr. Tshisekedi enjoys strong backing, many here in recent days have come to view Mr. Kabila suspiciously as a potential second incarnation of Mr. Mobutu. ""We've been fighting for democracy for years,"" said Alphonse Lupumba Kamanda, president of the Republican Front, which supports Mr. Tshisekedi. ""If Kabila can put an end to dictatorship, then we say yes. But if he comes with his guns, we will say no. We can't chase one dictator only to end up with another."" But Western officials here said that Mr. Tshisekedi's moment to lead Zaire is well behind him. ""I don't think Tshisekedi is a player,"" said a senior Western diplomat. ""You see his press saying it has to be settled by sitting Mobutu, Tshisekedi and Kabila around a table. But I don't think Kabila sees any reason to deal Tshisekedi into the game."" Zaire's war began last October, when Zairian ethnic Tutsi began an uprising in the eastern border region. The rebel movement was widely believed to have had the backing of Rwanda, Uganda, and Angola, all countries with scores to settle with Mr. Mobutu for having supported uprisings in their own country. After weeks of empty declarations from the Government, Mr. Mobutu could have seized the occasion to name a Prime Minister today, particularly Mr. Tshisekedi, who led the Government twice during 1993, Zairian leaders and people on the street interviewed here said. The crisis is being hotly debated today in the streets of Kinshasa, the capital. Throughout most of the day, the residents were anticipating a bolder move from the dictator, who is suffering from advanced prostate cancer. Many people said they had been expecting him to announce his resignation, or at least to name a Prime Minister. So tonight when Mr. Mobutu failed to appear in person, there was deep disappointment. In bars in the working class neighborhood of Matonga, at the university and on the streets, people said they had been expecting Mr. Mobutu to announce his resignation. ""I want Mobutu to go,"" said Paul Tsimva, 40, an unemployed civil servant. ""He has done nothing for the country except to enrich his friends and his cronies."" Such talk, which never would have been heard here during the years when Mr. Mobutu was the unquestioned ruler, was echoed over and over. The stage was set for a challenge to Mr. Mobutu in 1991 after Zaire's economy nearly collapsed, forcing Western donors to intervene politically here. Mr. Mobutu reluctantly agreed to share power then, but by manipulating divisions in the opposition, he managed to avoid actually doing so until the civil war erupted in the eastern region. ""Mr. Mobutu must exit the political stage gracefully,"" said an African diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""But that is difficult in our continent. After 30 years in power it is difficult to accept defeat.""","""1997-03-26T00:00:00Z""","""3SP8-8H50-000P-N0SB-00000-00"""

./samples/,"[16] Missionary Father Giulio Albanese has said that Zairean rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila is responsible for the deaths of 400,000 Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire. Albanese said that Kabila was the "" champion of a number of vested interests linked with the English-speaking world"" and was supported by technology made available by the United States and Britain. Kabila's plan, Albanese continued, was to expand throughout the Great Lakes region, acting not only on his own behalf but on that of Uganda and Rwanda. The "" elimination"" of the Hutu refugees was one of the ""favours"" Kabila was able to offer to Rwandan Vice-President and Defence Minister Paul Kagame. The following is the text of an interview with Albanese by Marco Tosatti in Vatican City, published by Italian newspaper 'La Stampa' on 5th May: Vatican City: In the Vatican the good news from the ship Outeniqua was received with satisfaction and a good pinch of scepticism. We spoke to Father Giulio Albanese, a Combonian missionary with much experience of the Great Lakes region, who is currently in Rome. [Tosatti] Can we believe the agreement reached and Kabila's promise to halt his men? [Albanese] I spoke just now to Kinshasa and, according to diplomatic circles, Kabila will halt his men only after the meeting to be held on board the Outeniqua in six to ten days'time, when the situation should basically be defined at last. There should be a transitional government to ensure the move towards an election. [Q] Will Kabila honour the assurances he gave [South African President] Mandela about a democratic transition? [A] The opposition in Kinshasa is afraid that once Kabila has taken power and occupied the city he will say: Yes, we will hold a free election, but only when the country is ready. It is feared that there will be a repetition of what [Ugandan President] Yoweri Museveni did when he seized Kampala in 1986. This is because Kabila is following to the letter everything that Museveni has taught him. [Q] Who is behind Kabila? [A] I am convinced that Kabila has become the herald, the champion of a number of vested interests linked with the English-speaking world - not necessarily of US extraction only, but including them. There certainly are a number of joint ventures which have signed contracts with Kabila - joint ventures connected to the South African De Beers (diamond) company, but which extend well beyond South Africa. It is they who invented ""Executive Outcomes"", though they have never admitted it - the mercenary agency that has become notorious in Africa in recent years. It is they who supported [UNITA leader Jonas] Savimbi against [Angolan President] Dos Santos in Angola. [Q] But will a democratic Zaire be possible after Mobutu? [A] I am very confused about the scenarios. Kabila is a very astute man and he is revealing political qualities that I would never have imagined him to have. But I do not know whether it is he who holds the reins, who is steering the ship. One thing is certain: Kabila is linked to the Simba war of 1964 and to drug trafficking. He is someone who has been involved in all sorts of dirty business: I am very sceptical about his having converted now, about his supporting a democratic platform... [Newspaper ellipsis] But miracles are possible. [Q] But what was the reason for the massacre of the refugees? [A] Kabila is executing a plan to expand throughout the Great Lakes region on behalf of the Kagame-Kabila-Museveni triumvirate. The war in Zaire was not fought by the Banyamulenge. The Banyamulenge army consists of 2,000 men. A mere 2,000 men could not have done all that was done. Kabila has been able to do what he has done because he had behind him Uganda, Rwanda and a whole technology made available to him by other powers, including the United States and Britain.

./samples/,"South Africa's declaration Sunday that it recognised rebel leader Laurent Kabila as legitimate head of Zaire is expected to open the way to worldwide acknowledgement of this African nation's new regime. Other African countries had already pledged their support Saturday and Sunday, but the combination of South Africa's announcement and indications the United States is edging towards official recognition suggest international approval is imminent. The sign most western countries are waiting for is assurance from Kabila that he will stick to his pledges of democracy. Saturday, just after his forces seized the Zairean capital Kinshasa, Kabila declared himself president, promised to form a transitional government by Tuesday and to call a constituent assembly within 60 days. days. He also announced that Zaire would now be known as ""The Democratic Republic of the Congo""--its name in 1965 when Mobutu took power. South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki told journalists in Lumbubashi Sunday after a meeting with Kabila that his government recognised Kabila as president. Mbeki, who met Kabila with South African Defence Minister Joe Modise and Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, said he was satisfied the transitional government would be broad-based. ""It's important during this transitional period that the people should enjoy democratic rights and democratic freedoms,"" he said. ""The approach of the alliance to this question is indeed that. It is itself an alliance of democratic forces."" Just hours earlier in Lumbubashi, UN special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun said he had held ""very encouraging"" talks Kabila on ""the future of governance in Zaire, and democracy."" Sahnoun, who also represents the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), was speaking before boarding a plane for Addis Ababa where he would brief OAU officials. Sahnoun said on his arrival from Kigali earlier in the day that the entry of Kabila's troops into Kinshasa with little bloodshed ""indicated that the people of Zaire are happy"" to have Kabila take over. It showed that this was ""the wish of the people,"" he said. OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim had said in a statement issued from Addis Ababa Saturday: ""We look forward to working with Kabila and his new administration,"" even referring to the rebel leader as ""President Kabila."" Without being so forthright, the United States nevertheless said Sunday it would work with Kabila. Speaking to television network CNN, White House national security adviser Sandy Berger said: ""Through our embassy we have urged (Kabila) to respect human rights, urged him to form a government that is inclusive and ultimately to move towards democracy and we are going to continue to work with him towards that."" Berger added that Washington has ""maintained contact"" with Kabila through Bill Richardson, the US ambassador to the United Nations. African nations that backed Kabila were the first to recognise his victory. Tanzania had been the first to officially accept Kabila's authority, President Benjamin Mkapa saying Saturday he would recognise the new government to be formed by Kabila. The Angolan government, accused by Kabila's opponents of backing him, followed with an announcement praising Kabila's ""victory."" Sunday, Rwanda welcomed what it called ""the smooth takeover"" with government spokesman Major Wilson Rutaysire adding: ""We now have a neighbour who is not hostile."" Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi announced later that Kenya will recognise the government to be formed under Kabila, adding he was ""satisfied that Kabila had good intentions for the people of Zaire,"" the KNA agency said For its part, the French government, a former Mobutu ally, indicated Saturday in a statement from its foreign ministry that ""we are expecting the new leadership to rapidly meet the conditions of an orderly transition in the spirit of national reconciliation."" ""We will be watching the actions of the new authorities very closely. Our relationship with them will depend on what happens,"" it added. bur/rmb/pcj pcj","""1997-05-18T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-3500-0025-F4Y4-00000-00"""

./samples/,"JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (AF P) - Laurent Kabila, president of the new Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire, has seized a private South African Learjet after claiming its ""rude"" pilot stood him up, a press report said here Sunday. Kabila impounded the jet in the southern provincial capital of Lubumbashi after the pilot, who agreed to fly him to a May 9 meeting with President Nelson Mandela in South Africa, left without him after waiting for six hours, Johannesburg's Sunday Independent newspaper said. ""The pilot was rude to me,"" Kabila told the aircraft's owners, according to the newspaper. newspaper. newspaper. The Learjet-24 was chartered by a Canadian-based company, American Mineral Fields (AMF), which signed a mining deal with the then-rebel leader Kabila prior to his victorious march last month on Kinshasa. The company had a standing agreement that Kabila could use their aircraft whenever he needed it, if it was available, the Sunday Independent said. On May 8, Kabila informed the mining house that he wished to use the jet at 9.00 a.m. the following morning to travel to South Africa to meet Mandela, who was leading a bid for a peaceful end to the Zairean civil war. The crew and aircraft were ready at the scheduled time, but when Kabila had not shown up by 3.00 p.m., the pilot decided to resume his normal schedule and took off for Harare, Zimbabwe, the newspaper said. Kabila's security men tried to prevent the takeoff, telling the pilot: ""If you go, don't ever come back."" The pilot and crew, however, returned to Lubumbashi, a primary base for Kabila's forces, with several passengers and were told by the same security officials they should park the jet next to a runway and find other means to leave the country. ""The instruction came from Kabila himself and the pilots obliged,"" the newspaper quoted a source close to Kabila as saying. Interjet of South Africa, which manages and services the plane, has retaliated by threatening to impound two aircraft--a Hawker Siddley 125 and Falcon 900--owned by the Gecamine parastatal mining firm, owned by Kabila's new administration. The Congolese planes are currently in South Africa being serviced by Interjet, which has set Sunday as a release deadline for its own aircraft, the report said. Lloyd's of London, which has insured the South African plane, has also written to Kabila requesting the release of the jet, the newspaper said. ""Thse guys seem not to understand what is going on. They have no idea of the implications,"" a South African source told the newspaper. The incident has soured relations between Kabila and AMF, which beat two South African mining giants in bidding for lucrative mineral rights in Katanga, one of the richest mineral zones in the world, the newspaper said. Kabila held several rounds of talks with Mandela, and met once with former Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko aboard a South African navy ship docked in the Congo, as part of South African-led peace efforts. The rebel leader stormed the capital of Kinshasa on May 18, after refusing Mobutu's proposals for a transitional government. gam/ss ss ss","""1997-06-15T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-2YT0-0025-F1CN-00000-00"""
./samples/,"U.S. envoy Bill Richardson said Wednesday that Zaire's ailing president and the rebel leader trying to topple him will meet on a South African boat Friday. Richardson, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said the boat would set sail from Libreville, Gabon, and then head into international waters. He said the talks would be chaired by the United Nations. Richardson has been in Zaire since Monday trying to broker talks between President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila. ''This is an historic occasion that hopefully will lead to peace in Zaire,''  Richardson told reporters after meeting with Mobutu in the capital Wednesday afternoon. He said there would be other African presidents present at the talks, but didn't specify which countries would be represented. Kabila and Mobutu had agreed earlier in the week to meet each other, but there was debate over the venue. The rebels say there is only one thing to discuss: Mobutu's departure from power. Richardson talked with Kabila for three hours Tuesday night in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi. South Africa has offered to have the talks held on one of its naval supply ships, which would be anchored in international waters off the coast of Zaire and Angola. The blunt-talking Richardson pressed Mobutu to accept that he cannot stop the rebels and urged him to agree to immediate peace talks. ''There can be no military solution to this crisis,''  Richardson said. Before meeting with Richardson, Kabila's foreign affairs minister said there would be one chance at talks and that they would be brief because the only topic would be the end of Mobutu's 32-year dictatorship. ''We are not going there to discuss a cease-fire,''  Bizima Karaha told reporters. ''We are going there to discuss the end of the war, a complete end of the war. And a complete end of the war can only come about when the man who brought the war is no longer there.''  Furthermore, the rebels who have seized more than half of Africa's third-largest nation in seven months will not stop their offensive while waiting for a settlement, he said. Tuesday morning, the rebels easily captured Kikwit, a city on a major highway 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the capital, Karaha said. ''The next stop is Kinshasa,''  he said. The United States is pushing strongly for a cease-fire and negotiations leading to an inclusive transitional government, Richardson said. Then, the United States would like to see Zairians hold elections, he said. Mobutu, 66, has insisted he would never bow to Kabila's demand he resign, but he is under increasing pressure. He is ill with prostate cancer, Western powers have urged him to give up, and the political opposition within Zaire is gaining momentum with each rebel victory.

The son of Patrice Lumumba, the prime minister who was murdered in February 1961, less than a year after independence, added in Geneva that he planned to go to Goma in eastern Zaire for a meeting with rebel leader Laurent Kabila. Kabila's rebel alliance, in which Zairean Tutsis hold key posts, benefits from diplomatic support and facilities to ship in arms through Uganda, Sudan and Rwanda, Lumumba told the press. press. ""We don't have any complexes if people give us certain facilities to finish off the Mobutu regime,"" he said. Mobutu has ruled Zaire for more than 31 years and was deeply implicated in events surrounding Lumumba's death and a foiled secession bid by the mineral-rich province of Katanga (now Shaba), which is once again in rebel hands. Lumumba, 45, was passing through Geneva after visiting Washington for talks with State Department officials and some 30 black American congressmen. He had lived in exile in Switzerland between 1975 and 1980. The son of Patrice Lumumba, whose murder sparked outrage in much of Africa, now lives in the Zairean capital Kinshasa and plans to return there after going to Goma on the eastern border with Rwanda. He heads the Lumumba National Congolese Movement (MNCL), which is not part of the rebel alliance, but is prepared to work with it for the overthrow of Mobutu and to take part in a transitional government. Lumumba said his party would put up a candidate in presidential elections that should follow the toppling of Mobutu, but the choice of candidate had not yet been made. He claimed that the MNCL had many supporters, some of whom were taking part in the armed uprising. He ruled out a transition government including the current head of state, saying ""Forget Mobutu.""

./samples/,"Zaire's ailing president and the rebel leader fighting to topple him will meet Friday on a South African navy ship, U.S. envoy Bill Richardson announced Wednesday. Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, patched together the meeting after reports emerged that President Mobutu Seso Seko was backing away from his promise to meet face-to-face with rebel leader Laurent Kabila. ""President Mobutu, in a statesman-like and patriotic fashion, agreed to the talks a few moments ago,"" Richardson said after meeting with Mobutu. Richardson, who has been in Zaire since Monday trying to arrange the talks, said the ship would set sail from Libreville, Gabon, and then head into international waters. The talks will be chaired by the United Nations. He said Kabila had agreed to the talks at a meeting Tuesday in the southern city of Lubumbashi. ""This is an historic occasion that hopefully will lead to peace in Zaire,"" Richardson said Wednesday. ""The U.S. is proud to have played this catalyst role. But now it must turn to Zairians and Africans and the United Nations to bring about this peaceful transition."" The United States is pushing for a cease-fire and negotiations leading to a transitional government that would include rebels and opposition parties, Richardson said. Then it would like to see Zaire hold a free, fair election. ""It is our hope there will be a cease-fire while the talks take place,"" he said. Richardson, who will attend the start of the talks, said other African presidents would be at the talks but he did not identify them. South African President Nelson Mandela has been instrumental in bringing the two sides together and likely will attend the talks himself. Richardson spoke twice by telephone with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Wednesday before she departed Washington for Moscow to meet with Russian officials. ""We hope they can agree to a transition that will lead to democracy and elections in Zaire,"" State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said of the meeting between Mobutu and Kabila. Burns told reporters aboard Albright's plane en route to Moscow that Kabila had given assurances he will hold rebel soldiers responsible for any massacres. But Burns said the rebels are still preventing U.N. observers from getting to refugee sites. ""Mr. Kabila's credibility is on the line,"" Burns said. At the United Nations in New York, Secretary-General Kofi Annan hailed the plan to meet and said the world body was determined to ensure peaceful change in Zaire. ""The secretary-general is determined to work with the international community to ensure that this change is managed in a concerted and focused manner to avoid further loss of innocent lives,"" the world body said in a statement. Kabila and Mobutu had agreed earlier in the week to meet each other, but there was debate over the venue. The rebels - who have captured more than half of Zaire since September - say there is only one thing to discuss: Mobutu's departure from power. The blunt-talking Richardson has pressed Mobutu to accept that he cannot stop the rebels and urged him to agree to immediate peace talks. ""There can be no military solution to this crisis,"" Richardson said. The rebels will not stop their offensive while waiting for a settlement, said spokesman Bizima Karaha. On Tuesday, the rebels easily captured Kikwit, a city on a major highway 250 miles east of the capital, he said. ""The next stop is Kinshasa,"" the spokesman. Mobutu, 66, has insisted he would never bow to Kabila's demand that he resign, but he is under increasing pressure. He is ill with prostate cancer, Western powers have urged him to give up, and the political opposition within Zaire is gaining momentum with each rebel victory.","""1997-04-30T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8DF0-000Y-K489-00000-00"""
./samples/,"President Mobutu Sese Seko had soldiers pull the prime minister off the streets Wednesday as his reign appeared to crumble even further. The White House urged him to make way for a democratic government, calling his three-decade dictatorship ""a creature of history."" The Zairian president, who had declared a nationwide state of emergency on Tuesday in response to rebel advances, named an army general as the new prime minister. Gen. Likulia Bolongo had previously served Mobutu as defense minister and army chief of staff. Likulia promised a crackdown on civil liberties, saying his primary goal was ""the restoration of public order."" The four-star general, dressed in his army uniform and surrounded by four other officers, did not elaborate on the crackdown at a news conference, but said measures would be taken against the news media if they published articles that ""affected the morale of the military."" Several foreign journalists, including an Associated Press photographer and APTV cameraman, were beaten and had their cameras stolen by soldiers during an anti-government demonstration Wednesday. And in southeastern Zaire, rebels bent on ending Mobutu's nearly 32-year dictatorship reportedly captured Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city. They have already captured the eastern third of Zaire in their seven-month campaign. The United States increased pressure on Mobutu to leave office, with White House spokesman Mike McCurry saying that U.S. officials want to see a transitional government, then elections. ""That clearly reflects our view that Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history,"" McCurry said. Last week, political parties allied against Mobutu named Etienne Tshisekedi as their choice for prime minister. Mobutu accepted his nomination in what was seen as a ploy to weaken the opposition by splitting it between Tshisekedi's supporters and those ready to join rebel leader Laurent Kabila. Tshisekedi is revered in Zaire for the suffering he endured during his decades of opposition to Mobutu. Since his appointment, he had moved to undermine Mobutu by ordering parliament dissolved, annulling the constitution and offering Cabinet posts to the rebels. The opposition lawmakers who had nominated him said he had gone too far, and they joined Mobutu supporters in calling for his ouster. On Wednesday, Tshisekedi tried to lead thousands of supporters to the prime minister's office to assume control. Walking in the huge crowd with his hand raised in a victory salute, Tshisekedi confronted a row of soldiers backed by troops in armored personnel carriers. The showdown took place near a monument to peace and freedom erected in a traffic circle. Mobutu's son, Capt. Mobutu Kongulu, appeared to be leading the soldiers. Hundreds of them fired tear gas at the marchers, with one canister landing near Tshisekedi. He was hustled into an army vehicle and driven away. ""Mr. Tshisekedi was brought to his home for his own safety,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Leon Kalima said. ""He is not under house arrest."" Tshisekedi, later seen at him home conferring with aides, refused to speak to reporters. Bruno Tshibala, one of the founders of Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress, said the protests would continue. ""We are living through the last acts of a desperate administration about to fall,"" he said. The ouster of Tshisekedi and his replacement with a military general were further setbacks to Zaire's long-stalled democratic reforms. A top aide to Tshisekedi said the ousted prime minister was pleased with the White House comment. ""The U.S. administration has finally come to see that the post-Mobutu era has arrived,"" Mtumbabo Clement said. The rebels, meanwhile, said Tshisekedi's removal was insignificant to their cause. ""He never had any power anyway,"" said Mawampanga Mwana Nanga, economic minister at rebel headquarters in the eastern city of Goma. A resident of Lubumbashi, capital of the copper- and cobalt-rich Shaba region, said Wednesday that the rebels were exchanging gunfire with Zairian soldiers in the city. Thierry Mwengwe said he and other civilians in the southeastern city were in hiding. A commander at the rebels' headquarters in Goma, who identified himself as Mufu, said the rebels control Lubumbashi. The unrest throughout Zaire prompted the United Nations to begin reducing its staff in Kinshasa. U.N. spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt said 12 staff members would leave the capital within 48 hours. Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed an order Wednesday for a possible evacuation of Russians in Zaire. U.S., French, British and Belgian troops are standing by in neighboring Congo for possible evacuations of their citizens.","""1997-04-09T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8NS0-000Y-K24T-00000-00"""
./samples/,"[13] Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), has said that he is ""looking forward to a time"" when the United Nations has left Angola. Angolans must behave responsibly, he went on, ""as people who are in charge of our country's destiny"" . Savimbi made clear that he would not countenance playing a double role as UNITA leader and Angolan vice-president. He said the party must decide which position he was to occupy. On the question of the diamonds in UNITA-controlled areas, Savimbi stressed that UNITA ""cannot be left without resources"" . They had given up their army and their weapons; it was unrealistic to expect them to give up all their wealth. The following are excerpts from an interview by Mario Ribeiro with Savimbi in Morocco, broadcast by PortugueseRenascenca radio on 27th June; subheadings inserted editorially: ...One of the fresh developments disclosed by Jonas Savimbi in this interview is the plan to open a UNITA delegation in Rome in the near future, a move regarded by Savimbi as a rapprochement with the Catholic Church: Savimbi We must get close to everyone who may potentially contribute to peace and we believe that Italy is in a position to do so. Both the Italian government itself - for it has interests in our part of the world - and above all the Church, the Vatican, which has great moral influence and to which we therefore wish to convey our message directly. Ribeiro What contacts have you had with the Vatican? A Through our priests in Rome, through the friends we have in Rome and through envoys we have been sending to Rome. I believe that our contacts are developing apace. Q Any chance of being received by Pope John Paul II? A I would like that to happen; we have requested an audience. It will depend on the Vatican's willingness to grant it. The composition of the Angolan government Q Did you regard the dismissal of Angolan Prime Minister Marcolino Moco as inevitable? A I don't know about that. Such things happen within government circles. I am not au fait with internal differences of opinion and suchlike. All I do is note what happens... Q With the creation of two vice-presidencies, the post of prime minister will in all likelihood become meaningless - if it was not so already. What is your opinion on this? A My views are exactly the same as those of the UNITA delegation negotiating the revision of the constitution: either we have a prime minister and the vice-presidencies can be done away with, or we have the vice-presidencies but no prime minister. This is currently under discussion. In my opinion there would be an overlap of jurisdictions. What would the task of the vice-presidents be? This is a point on which UNITA is not in agreement with the government. We don't want vice-presidents whose job is merely to cut ceremonial tapes. Q Do you believe that the latest government reshuffle will make it possible, as President Eduardo dos Santos said, to put an end to corruption, to have greater transparency in government? Do you believe Luanda is truly committed to bringing this about? A I cannot pass judgment in advance. There is no-one new in the reshuffled government . Dr Franca Van-Dunem himself was prime minister before and has held several ministerial posts. No new figures have been brought in. I would like this to change. Fresh people are needed to launch a national drive. I don't mean that the old ones should leave, but there is a need for fresh blood to help to change old habits. Over the past 20 years people have become accustomed to certain methods of working. I don't think that one speech alone is enough to change all that. Q Is this idea about fresh blood in any way related to UNITA's proposal that the future national unity government should cast its net wider? That instead of being made up only of UNITA and the MPLA it should include all the parties represented in parliament? A Yes, absolutely... Our formula would at least have the merit of bringing in all those who received votes from the people, people who therefore enjoy a certain measure of confidence or sympathy among the population... As far as I am concerned, the most important thing is to give the Angolan people the certainty that dialogue is possible, that we are all brothers. Our idea has this merit at least. As for economic and social issues, that is another problem, which will take a long time to tackle. Q Would you say that with such grave social problems the ordinary Angolan citizen has become more embittered, harder, more corrupt? A Well, let us not put it like that. It is not a question of the ordinary citizen, but rather, so to speak, of those in power. They have acquired bad habits over the past 20 years. It is not just me saying it, the Luanda papers say it too. The ordinary citizen does not endorse corruption; he adapts himself. If he is not given economic room, if he is not allowed to make his living with a trade, then he is forced to devise his own scams. But it corruption does not originate at the level of the ordinary citizen. It is impossible for corruption to start at the level of the man in the street. It is bound to start among those who wield power. Q I understand that the vice-president who will represent UNITA in the government will be nominated by the UNITA congress. Given your background, would you rather be vice-president in the future Angolan government or remain as UNITA leader? A I have said it before and my position remains unchanged: I wish to serve. I wish to serve Angola. But I am a party man. So it will be up to my party to decide. If the party decides that I must become vice-president of the republic, then I shall step forward. But in that event I cannot remain as party leader. Because the party, UNITA, must rebuild itself. We have had our disasters - military, political, diplomatic. Someone must lead the party for a prolonged period so that we can rebuild our values. This cannot be done by someone who is both vice-president and party leader. Alternatively, should they decide that I am to remain in the party, then we shall have to nominate someone for the vice-presidency. Q What names are being mentioned in the UNITA leadership for such an eventuality? A No names as such yet, because we have not even started the preparatory work for the third extraordinary congress. But they must have some ideas. I have none. It will be the prerogative of congress to put forward any names. Q Abel Chivukuvuku is being mentioned a lot. A If that is how they are thinking, they have told me, at least, nothing about it. Q Do you think he has what it takes? A He is an experienced man; yes, he has the experience... Comments on Angola's relations with the UN and with Portugal Q Now that we have reached the final stretch in the process of confining the troops to designated areas, what is your view of the UN's role in monitoring the process? Are you happy with it? A It is very difficult to assess and different people will have different views. One thing that I will say is that the merit was all on UNITA's side; the merit was all UNITA's. UNITA put up with all the insults, UNITA put up with all the lies, UNITA put up with all the distortions and UNITA forged ahead... As for what the UN has done, they are always trying to have it both ways - congratulating us on the one hand while on the other hand saying something quite different at the same time. I don't have a problem with the UN and I am consistent in this view. Why am I consistent in my view? Because the presence of Unavem-3 in Angola was a necessity. If the Angolans had managed to come to an understanding amongst themselves before, then we might have been able to do without it. Because the UN is not all good things - I saw what the UN did in the Congo, in Zaire, and we don't need that here. So I sincerely want the Angolans to get on together so that we can see the back of Unavem. I fervently want them to go. They have insulted us, they have lied to us, but never mind. Their six-month term is coming to an end and what is six months in the life of a nation? I am looking forward to a time when the UN has gone. We must behave responsibly, as people who are in charge of our country's destiny. So what they the UN say is not all that important. Q Let us talk about Portugal for a moment. Do you find a difference of attitude towards Angola between the Cavaco Silva and Guterres governments? A The Guterres government has not been in office long enough for us to pass judgment. But at least there is the difference that this government agrees to engage in dialogue... Q As you may know, there are strong ties between the government led by Antonio Guterres and the Angolan government. I would remind you that Secretary of State for Cooperation Jose Lamego was instrumental in securing membership of the Socialist International for the MPLA. Are you not disturbed by this? A Not at all. What does the Socialist International amount to these days? Q But it reflects a certain empathy between the two governments, so to speak. A That is not important. I believe that a time will come when Portugal's political leaders must take a statesmanlike attitude. And I am going to reiterate something that we feel very deeply: Angola cannot avoid Portugal. Not just because of the ancient ties that bind us together - the culture, the language and so on - but also because of the current political context, in which everyone who is interested in Angola goes first to Portugal for information. This is a fact which UNITA accepts. But we also wish to put a message across to Portugal ourselves. The message is that Portugal cannot ignore UNITA. We've been here for 30 years and we are not going away... Savimbi's relationship with the Angolan president Q What is your current relationship with President Eduardo dos Santos? Do you talk much? A Even from here in Morocco I have telephoned him several times. We have to liaise. We have a good understanding. If everything had depended only on him and on me, I believe that we would have made much swifter progress. But we each have our own troops to answer to and that is the important thing. Q What brings you together at this stage? A On the part of the president of the republic I believe it is the wish to leave a mark on the political and economic life of Angola. He knows that for all of its 20 years in power the MPLA has not managed to govern the country. The MPLA has not managed to govern and I would like to believe that he would like to do something, as a patriot and a responsible leader, to make some contribution to improving the people's economic well-being. As for me, I want to see Angola find a way out of this situation of permanent tutelage. The Angolans must find the capacity to govern themselves. There is a space they must occupy. So I think we're all agreed that the time has come for us to make a more positive contribution to the political, economic and social life of our country. Savimbi's views on diamonds, peace and the lusophone commonwealth Q I've heard that the president of Endiama Angola's national diamond company has visited Bailundo UNITA stronghold . Is this true? A It is true. But he did not talk to me. He had no business talking to me. I don't enter into talks about stones. I have not sunk so low as to discuss our sources of diamonds. Q Those stones are precious to UNITA. A Yes, they are, but I have not sunk that low. He had talks with other UNITA officials. I still don't know what they talked about because it was not important enough for me to ask for an immediate report. Yes, he paid a visit. We acknowledge that there are ongoing discussions, very realistic discussions. Q But aren't talks going on at present - or perhaps a deal has already been struck - between the Brazilians of name indistinct company, Endiama and UNITA, with a view to exploiting the country's diamond resources? A No, no. That is not true. The first contact - which I believe was positive, friendly - between Endiama and our people in the UNITA leadership was this recent meeting in Bailundo. So they are looking at possible understandings... The fact is, UNITA cannot be left without resources. It cannot. You cannot ask for everything. You say let us have your army! Here, have it. Let us have your weapons! Here, have them. Let us have your money! Oh, come on, be realistic: nobody will accept that. Q Are you prepared to channel some of the money, or the diamonds themselves, towards the reconstruction of Angola and its economy? A Let's see. There's something to be noted here in parenthesis. It is taken for granted that when the peace process reaches its conclusion UNITA must accept the jurisdiction of the central government over all the territory today controlled by UNITA. That is an accepted fact... As to whether the diamonds will go to the national economy, I have my doubts. Judging by what is happening in the Lundas two provinces, north and south it looks unlikely. Those diamonds are more likely to end up lining certain generals' pockets. But that is none of my business. Q Are you afraid of the Luanda generals? A Never. Never. Besides, I don't deal with generals; I deal with politicians. I am no longer a general; I'm a politician. A general in the reserve list is not really a general any more. Q Do you definitely believe that peace is irreversible and that there is no way that war can return to Angola? A As far as UNITA is concerned, yes. As far as the government is concerned, I don't know. What I can say as far as the government is concerned - but I would not hold my hand over a flame about it - is that President Eduardo dos Santos is keen on peace. He is. Now, whether everyone else is keen, that I don't know. Q Still on the question of the rapprochement with Portugal. What role do you see UNITA playing in the setting up of the commonwealth of Portuguese-speaking countries? A At least to reflect upon it, to share its thoughts with those interested in creating a Portuguese-speaking area - Ribeiro, interrupting Do you think it is an important space? A Yes, it is important, but they're going about defining it in the wrong way. They are defining it on the basis of the regimes in power, only on the basis of language, culture and business. Let it be defined as a strategic space, a political-strategic space, and then the business, the language, the regimes will all fall into place within this framework, which is much more important...","""1996-06-30T00:00:00Z""","""3S51-J5N0-0017-G0M9-00000-00"""
./samples/,"BUJUMBURA (AP-CP) - Burundi's Tutsi-led army installed its own military ruler Thursday, sealed the borders and ordered civilians off the streets after overthrowing the country's Hutu president. Coup leaders acted to stop ""our people's descent into hell,''  newly installed leader Pierre Buyoya told the country in a national radio broadcast. ""We demand that the international community understand the purpose of our efforts,''  said Buyoya, restored by the coup to a position he lost to a Hutu in a 1993 presidential election. ""What happened today was not a change of regime through ambition, glory or anything else. ""What happened today was an action of salvation,''  he said. Western leaders condemned the coup, fearing it could bring on ethnic warfare on the scale of neighboring Rwanda's genocide but said nothing about sending troops to restore President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who headed a Tutsi-Hutu coalition government. The Canadian government said it ""deplored the military takeover of the government in Burundi and called for the restoration of democratic and political institutions.''  A statement by Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy and Minister for International Co-operation Pierre Pettigrew said of the coup: ""Such action offers no solution to Burundi's long-term problems.''  Soldiers and police patrolled the central African country's capital. Troops shut the airport and a dozen paratroopers patrolled the state-run TV station, which was surrounded by barbed wire. The coup follows three years of civil war between the country's Hutus and Tutsis that has killed more than 150,000 people. The two-day-old army uprising apparently has been free of violence, although there were reports the country's main Hutu opposition party would try to lay siege to Bujumbura and Gitega, UN undersecretary general Chinmaya Gharekhan said in New York City. Burundi's ethnic mix - and hatred - is similar to that of Rwanda, where Hutu militia slaughtered a half-million Tutsis and moderate Hutus two summers ago. The Rwandan genocide was prompted in part by Hutus' fears Tutsis would try to regain the power they held until their monarchy was overthrown in 1959. In Burundi, however, the Tutsis have been in control since the country's independence in 1962. The military coup does not alter the balance of power; no matter who has occupied the presidency, Burundi's Tutsi-run military has always run the country. Burundi is on the northeast side of Lake Tanganyika and is bordered by Tanzania, Rwanda and Zaire. In a 10-minute address, Buyoya said his first mission as head of a transitional government will be ""to stop - and quickly - the massacres and all kinds of criminality that have been prevailing in Burundi for almost three years.''  Ntibantunganya, who took refuge at the U.S. ambassador's residence Tuesday night, has not resigned as leader of the country's coalition government, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Judith Kaula said. ""This is not the worst-case scenario, because it's not your classic bloody coup in the middle of the night,''  she said. At least eight other Hutus, among them three prominent politicians, sought refuge Thursday in the German ambassador's residence. There are 89 Canadians registered as being in Burundi. Most of them are relief workers, missionaries or entrepreneurs. No evacuation was ordered immediately but contingency plans are in place. Betty de Jong, who works for World Vision Canada in Bujumbura, said she will go to work as usual today. ""We're in an area that is not so secure,''  said de Jong, from Hamilton, Ont., ""and yet outside it's just as calm and peaceful as could be.''  She took a local worker home after the coup announcement and saw ""masses of Hutus swarming up this road to their commune in the hills. (But) everything was really orderly.''  She was stopped three times by the military during the 20-minute drive. After explaining the purpose of the trip, she said, ""I got the thumbs-up sign. No problem whatsoever. ""They were very polite.''  The United States condemned the coup and called on military leaders to resolve the political crisis peacefully. UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the Organization of African Unity said the international community will not accept a Burundian government installed by force. UN officials are working on two contingency plans - one to provide aid if the country collapses in violence and the other to send troops to Burundi to prevent ethnic slaughter. Only Zambia, Malawi and Chad have offered soldiers, however. Rwanda accuses the United Nations of standing aside in 1994 as Hutu troops and allied militiamen slaughtered 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis.","""1996-07-25T00:00:00Z""","""4705-JF10-01G6-81WC-00000-00"""
./samples/,"By Christophe Parayre BUJUMBURA, July 28 (AFP) - Regional leaders called a summit over the coup in Burundi as talks continued here Sunday on the fate of its deposed Hutu leaders, including the ousted president. In Kampala, the presidents of Tanzania and Uganda, Benjamin Mkapa and Yoweri Museveni, ""strongly condemned and rejected"" Thursday's army-backed bloodless coup which ousted President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya. They announced that a regional summit would be held on Wednesday in Arusha, northern Tanzania. In Bujumbura meanwhile, Burundi's new strongman Major Pierre Buyoya denied he was a hostage to the army, and said he wanted Ntibantunganya and the other deposed ministers to stay in the country. ""I have never been a hostage to the army,"" he told a news conference. ""I was asked (to take over) because the army still believes in me. I will accompany it in the democratisation process."" Ntibantunganya has been holed up in the US ambassador's residence here since Tuesday. He sought shelter after being attacked by stone-throwing crowds at a funeral for 340 Tutsis, victims of ethnic massacres. Several ministers sought refuge in the Belgian, French and German embassies. As diplomats wrangle with the new authorities over the future of the deposed leaders, Buyoya said he wanted them to remain in the country. ""The authorities should go home,"" he added. ""We will offer them security and participation in the structures of transition to put Burundi back on track."" ""I think they must work on the ground (in Burundi) rather than leave the country,"" he added, but said each case had to be studied individually. He also said he was prepared to meet Ntibantunganya, who has not yet resigned, if the latter wanted. Buyoya, a Tutsi, has declared himself interim president and announced he will form a transitional government. Burundi's 5.5 million population is 85 percent Hutu and 14 percent Tutsi. World leaders fear the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people in three years could degenerate into a bloodbath similar to the one in Rwanda in 1994 which left 500,000 dead. The announcement by Mkapa and Museveni followed weekend talks with former Tanzanian head of state Julius Nyerere, the principal African mediator in the Burundi conflict. Their statement said: ""The military coup undermines the efforts being undertaken by both regional and world leaders aimed at finding a peaceful and lasting solution to the Burundi conflict that would guarantee security and democracy to all the people of Burundi."" Ugandan government sources said Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire, Kenya and Ethiopia would take part in the summit. Leaders of those same countries met on June 25 in Arusha where they agreed to a Burundi government request for military intervention to halt inter-ethnic bloodshed in the west African state. However, a peacekeeping force failed to materialise. Mkapa and Museveni underlined ""the importance of the agreement reached at the regional summit"" and urged all parties to respect its recommendations. Ugandan government sources also revealed Museveni had received a delegation from Buyoya on Saturday. No country has yet recognised Burundi's new authorities. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) condemned the coup. Many western countries, despite initial outrage, have contented themselves with deploring the interruption of the democratic process in Burundi, a process initiated by Buyoya during his last term in office. Buyoya came to power in 1987 after a coup which ousted then Tutsi president Jean-Baptiste Bazaga. He launched a democracy drive which ended in his defeat in the 1993 presidential election. Four months later Melchior Ndadaye, the country's first elected Hutu president, was assassinated in a coup bid by the Tutsi-dominated army. vm-sa/jl/km/gd AFP Burundi's new leader Pierre Buyoya, who seized power in an army-backed coup last week, on Sunday said he would form a transition government by the end of the week.

./samples/,"With dictator Mobutu Sese Seko's riverside palace in rebel hands along with the fortified military base that protected it Kinshasa was fully in rebel control on Sunday, and a rebel leadership delegation was on its way to the city. The U.S. State Department said it was granting rebel leader Laurent Kabila ''de facto''  recognition of the presidency of Zaire he had proclaimed for himself on Saturday. Some Kinshasans rushed the streets of the city on Sunday morning, after a night of sporadic violence that left at least 26 dead. Some shouted ''Liberte!''  and burned the flag they associated with nearly 32 years of Mobutu's despotic rule. There were conflicting reports on the whereabouts of Mobutu himself. Authorities at a military airport in the Moroccan capital of Rabat said Mobutu arrived there at 3 a.m. (0300 GMT) Sunday. The entourage arrived in one civilian plane and two military planes, and immediately went to a resort hotel on the sea, just south of the Moroccan capital, the authorities said on condition of anonymity. But a Mobutu spokesman in Paris said the deposed strongman was still in his home village of Gbadolite in northern Zaire Sunday morning. He had fled there hours before the rebels marched into the city. At the rebel's headquarters in Lubumbashi, the rebel alliance's finance minister, Mwana Nanga Mawampanga, said a delegation headed by Deo Bugera, the group's secretary general, would arrive Sunday to set up a local government. The finance minister said the alliance routinely sends a political delegation to newly-captured territory, ''to reassure the population, to explain our message.''  When asked when rebel leader Laurent Kabila may go to Kinshasa, the minister replied, ''Very soon. In the next couple of days, or a few days...It's at his discretion.''  State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the United States could work with Kabila as ''president''  of Zaire. ''Of course we're going to continue working with Mr. Kabila in his new position as we have worked with him quite regularly over the last couple of months during the civil war and the rebellion,''  Burns told the British Broadcasting Corp. ''It's a de facto recognition. There will be no need for a formal, you know, statement from the U.S. government.''  The BBC also reported that Kabila had the de facto recognition of the Organization of African Unity.

./samples/,"Laurent Kabila's rebels seized full control of the capital Sunday and acted quickly to assert their authority, disarming ousted President Mobutu Sese Seko's soldiers and brutally killing some of them. Rebels captured Mobutu's riverside palace and the fortified military base that protected it, completing Saturday's takeover of Kinshasa. Rebel forces entered Kinshasa, largely unopposed, a day after Mobutu fled the city Friday. Kinshasans rushed into the streets of the city on Sunday morning after a night of violence that left at least 26 dead. Some shouted ""Liberte!"" and burned the flag they associated with nearly 32 years of Mobutu's despotic rule. In the La Cite district - near the home of popular opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi - residents danced around the charred remains of seven soldiers killed by the rebels. Witnesses said two of the soldiers were still alive when they were set afire. Elsewhere in the city, civilians taunted government troops who were obeying a rebel order to hand in their guns. The crowd pushed forward one man, whom the rebels took away for interrogation, beat bloody, and then executed. ""They're going to kill me! They're going to kill me now!"" the despairing man called just before a rebel fighter shot him in the back. It was not known who the man was or why he was executed There were conflicting reports on the whereabouts of Mobutu himself. Authorities at a military airport in the Moroccan capital of Rabat said Mobutu arrived there at 3 a.m. Sunday. The entourage arrived in one civilian plane and two military planes, and immediately went to a resort hotel on the sea, just south of the Moroccan capital, the authorities said on condition of anonymity. But a Mobutu spokesman in Paris said the deposed president was still in his home village of Gbadolite in northern Zaire Sunday morning. He had fled there hours before the rebels marched into the city.

U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun flew to Lubumbashi on Sunday to talk with Kabila and his officials about ""the future of Zaire."" Sahnoun noted that the people of Kinshasa had not fought Kabila's forces, which he said showed that the people wanted Kabila's rebel alliance there.

./samples/,"Activists and church leaders urged the U.S. government on Tuesday to lead international efforts aimed at peacefully ousting President Mobutu Sese Seko and all vestiges of ''Mobutuist tyranny from Zaire.''  Prolonged fighting in the central African country could mean escalating bloodshed and even the destruction of Kinshasa, the capital, they warned. Known as Leopoldville under Belgian colonial rule that ended in 1960, its current population is about 4 million. ''Today we need to go beyond the current ineffectual policy of words and principles to actively engage with other governments in finding a non-violent democratic solution,''  more than 40 individuals and groups declared in a joint statement. The solution, they said, is negotiated creation of ''a legitimate, representative and inclusive, transitional government of national unity''  to prepare the ground for democratic elections and cope with humanitarian needs. The transitional government would be dominated by democratic forces opposed to Mobutu ''as well as representatives of civil society''  in the central African country. They could decide whether to include ''elements of the current (Mobutu) regime prepared to support truly democratic change,''  added the statement issued at a news conference sponsored by the private Council on Foreign Relations. The State Department was studying the document but had no immediate public comment. While critical of Mobutu, the U.S. official position is that his future is a matter for Zaireans to decide. Washington is pressing for early cease-fire talks between the government and rebels. ''The U.S. has been a major supporter of Mobutu's government over the decades,''  the statement said. ''For the past seven years Washington has failed to develop an effective strategy to achieve its stated goal of democratization. ''Given Zaire's enormous needs for economic and political reconstruction, the international community has significant leverage, but it needs to be used now,''  it added. The statement was intended as a signal that Zaire under Mobuto ''is beyond all hope, beyond rescue''  and facing chaos, said one of the signers, U.S. Committee on Refugees Executive Director Roger Winter. Other signers included Gay McDougall, executive director of the International Human Rights Law Group; Randall Robinson, president of TransAfrica; former Congressman Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y, and these religious leaders and the Rev.

./samples/,"Text of report by Gabonese Africa No 1 radio on 10th July Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo has announced that there will be a cabinet reshuffle in the next few days. Contacted by telephone by Mohamed Issoufou Saliou, the Zairean premier, whom you will be hearing in a moment, has appealed to the entire Zairean political class to take part in the future government that he will be forming. [Kengo - recording] On account of the new deal, demanded and decided after consultations with the president of the republic on 8th July, to enlarge my government to include all persuasions, I shall henceforth start meeting the various political families with a view to forming a national unity government, which will permit us to go the polls with the participation of all. [End of recording] It must be said that the announcement was more or less expected. The prime minister spent the greater part of his day carrying out political consultations with the various political forces in the country. The consultations are said to be aimed at easing the political tension in the country. The tension was born of the pressure put on the High Council of the Republic - Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] speaker by the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and the presidential group, demanding his resignation. The consultations have taken place after the meeting between Kengo Wa Dondo and President Mobutu at Gbadolite over the weekend and following Marshal Mobutu's decision to extend the transitional period by two years. The cabinet reshuffle was, therefore, virtually foreseeable. It, however, remains to be seen how the head of government's offer will be received by the parties who insist absolutely on the removal of Mgr Mosengwo as HCR-PT speaker. These parties already feel strong enough to demand the removal of Kengo Wa Dondo himself. USOR has just reacted to the determination of the prime minister to form a national unity government. According to USOR, it is not a makeshift solution that the opposition wants but a government that corresponds to the wishes of the Sovereign National Conference with, at its head, a prime minister that does not belong to President Mobutu's political family. Let us listen to the USOR spokesman Aime Zaye. [Zaye - recording] For the opposition forces, the issue is not one of a government reshuffle. The law must be respected. This means that since a new transitional period is beginning, the provisions of Article 78 of the constitution, on the appointment of a prime minister by the opposition, must be implemented. It is not a reshuffle but simply the formation of a national unity government that must be envisaged. If Mr Kengo would like to take part in these consultations, he is free to determine which of the two constitutional political families he belongs to, join the ranks of the family he thinks he belongs to and take part in the consultations which are part of the new beginning commencing on 10th July, in accordance with the revision of the constitution adopted by the assembly and promulgated recently by President Mobutu. We shall not negotiate this famous reshuffle. We are maintaining our demand for a return to law. This means the formation of a government headed by someone chosen by the political family to which the head of state does not belong, and it is not Mr Kengo.

./samples/,"By Mario Fiorito KINSHASA, Dec 17 (AFP) - President Mobutu Sese Seko, thinner after a prostate operation but still jaunty in his familiar leopardskin cap, jovially brandished a cane in greeting as he arrived back Tuesday in his war-torn, crumbling dictatorship. Mobutu arrived in Kinshasa after a four-month absence during which he underwent surgery in Switzerland and convalesced at his luxury villa on the French Riviera while rebels took over much of eastern Zaire. Marshal Mobutu, one of the last of the old guard of African strongmen, immediately went walkabout, shaking hands with some of the thousands marshalled to meet him at the airport. Mobutu was welcomed by Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo, surrounded by senior officials and party leaders with the notable exception of the longstanding opposition leader, Etienne Tshisekedi. Meanwhile, government officials were urging people onto the streets of Kinshasa to welcome the leader. The authorities earlier requisitioned buses and trucks to bring in crowds for what the pro-government Salongo newspaper on Tuesday forecast would be an ""ecstatic"" welcome. Other newspapers claimed the welcome would be a carefully stage-managed media event. The scene of conviviality with a smiling Mobutu surrounded by a milling crowd of welcomers contrasted with chaos elsewhere in a country no longer fully under his sway. Rebels controlling the east are intent on pressing on to Kinshasa and overthrowing the 66-year-old president. Mobutu, whose isolation abroad in Switzerland and France while his impoverished country was embroiled in armed conflict has led to widespread discontent, was expected to waste little time in trying to re-assert his authority. He was later going to Tshatshi barracks, where his presidential guard is based, to broadcast to the nation facing political chaos in Kinshasa as well as rebellion in the east. Mainly Tutsi rebels have captured a large swathe of eastern Zaire since October, and stated that their eventual aim is to overthrow the 31-year-old Mobutu regime. Government troops have been routed from towns in North and South Kivu provinces, including the provincial capitals, Goma and Bukavu. Kinshasa accuses Zaire's neighbours, particularly Tutsi-dominated Rwanda, but also Uganda and Burundi, of supporting the rebels. Earlier, a fleet of limousines and a minibus took Mobutu, his wife and entourage from the Roquebrune-Cap-Martin villa in the south of France to the Cote d'Azur airport at Nice, where the president boarded one of two DC8 airliners chartered by the Zaire government. Mobutu had arrived in France on November 4 after convalescing for two months in a luxury hotel in Lausanne following his surgery for prostate cancer in late August. He held several meetings with visiting officials at his luxury cliff-top villa on the French Riviera, where he has otherwise insulated himself from the chaos wracking his country. He held talks with several regional leaders who visited the villa as well as UN special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Canadian diplomat Raymond Chretien, who urged him to return home to try to bring peace to the region. Mobutu's supporters believe he may be able to lead a counter-offensive in the east to ""boot the enemy across the borders,"" as officials have put it. On the political front, newspapers close to Tshisekedi, Mobutu's main rival in the past, are being much quieter than usual in denouncing the ""dictator"" and looking for a reconciliation between their leader and the head of state. Tshisekedi's aides argue that the only ""legal"" way out of a political impasse is for the former premier to take back the helm and form a ""national unity government."" Even when he is in the country, public sightings of Mobutu in Zaire are rare. He made a brief visit to Kinshasa in January to commemorate the victims of the air disaster that killed 350 people when a plane crashed into a market near the airport. bur-mf/da/gd AFP Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko on Tuesday left his French Riviera villa to return home after almost five months of absence, official sources said.

./samples/,"Preparations proceed for peace talks that might not happen. Parliament chooses a presidential successor who might not take the job. The rebel leader talks of a settlement but fights his way toward the capital. In other words, it's business as usual in Kinshasa. The first face-to-face meeting between President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel chief Laurent Kabila on May 4 accomplished little except raise the level of uncertainty here. If the two meet again Wednesday in Pointe-Noire, Congo, as international mediators say they will, diplomats and politicians say it likely will be their last chance to peacefully sort out their differences. Failing that, Mobutu and Kabila will find themselves boxed further into their corners: Kabila forced to make good on his boasts to conquer Kinshasa; the ailing Mobutu forced to stand firm rather than quit in humiliation. ""The meeting Wednesday may very well be the last chance to find a negotiated settlement,"" South Africa's deputy president, Thabo Mbeki, said Monday. Mbeki, a key mediator, was to leave for the region later today. Publicly, South Africa and the United States - the major figures in starting the talks - are expressing optimism that Mobutu's inevitable departure from power will be achieved at Wednesday's meeting. ""What will be formed at these peace talks is an inclusive transitional government where power is handed over in a peaceful fashion,"" the United States' U.N. ambassador, Bill Richardson, said Sunday. But quietly these nations are preparing for the worst. The United States is set to evacuate Americans, has scaled back its embassy workers in the capital, and diplomatic staffers have put their valuables in storage in case fighting breaks out or soldiers loot the city, as they did in 1991 and 1993. The Zairian government, too, is preparing for bloodshed, calling today on Kinshasa residents to take up arms to defend the capital and imposing a dusk-to-dawn curfew. The inconclusive first round of talks May 4 highlighted the two leaders' intransigence. Kabila stuck to his demand that Mobutu resign immediately and hand power to a transitional authority that he would lead; Mobutu, ailing with prostate cancer but determined to make an honorable exit, refused and said he would only hand power to an elected president. Since then, the rebels have fought to a reported 30 miles from the capital and regular Zairians on the street appear eager to welcome Kabila's army into their dilapidated capital. Mobutu appeared to have given Kabila the key to the city when he announced his departure last Wednesday for a three-day trip to Gabon for talks with regional presidents. Despite loud threats, Kabila didn't make his move, possibly swayed by international pressure to hold off. But he was more likely influenced by concerns his men weren't battle-ready enough to take the capital in a quick swipe with a minimum of bloodshed. If observers were surprised by Mobutu's seemingly risky trip out of the country, many were equally surprised he came back rather than head into exile in the face of insurmountable military and political pressures. The parliament Sunday appeared to make a move toward creating some sense of order by selecting Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo as parliamentary president to assume power in Mobutu's absence - a sign a plan was in the works for the dictator to relinquish control. The idea presumably would be for Mobutu to hand power to a transitional authority led by the monsignor, who would then hand power to Kabila, thus sparing Mobutu the humiliation of handing over directly to the rebel chief. But Monsengwo, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Kisangani, hasn't said he'll take the job. He's also been rejected by opposition parties and by Kabila as a pawn for Mobutu. ""He's a politician in a bishop's robes,"" said opposition lawmaker Valentin Mubake Nombi. ""Kabila couldn't accept Monsengwo as president, even for one hour."" Thus, hopes are pinned on concessions by either Mobutu or Kabila when, or if, they meet again. Mbeki didn't mince words when asked what was at stake: ""If this agreement is not reached, in reality, it opens the way to a military solution being the only thing on the cards.""","""1997-05-13T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-87X0-000Y-K18F-00000-00"""
./samples/,"[3] Rebel leader Laurent Kabila has said in an interview that he is prepared to hold talks with the leadership in Kinshasa but would not be willing to share power with them. Talks must be held to stop violence but the government wants the violence to continue in order to hold onto power, he said. Following is the text of a report and interview by Zairean rebel radio from Bukavu on 23rd November The Goma-Bukavu road will very soon be open for movement after the clearing of a few hidden shooters, who are in disarray. This is a quote from the declaration made on Friday [22nd November] to the international press by the president of the Alliance of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire [ADFLCZ], Laurent-Desire Kabila. The plan is possible thanks to the victory of the alliance forces over the coalition of the Zairean Armed Forces [FAZ] and the FAR [former Rwandan Armed Forces], the alliance president stressed. He also referred to Thursday's [21st November] fighting on the Walikale-Lubutu road, during which elements of the Zairean Armed Forces supported by FAR abandoned a fair quantity of heavy weapons and ammunition following their defeat. According to President Kabila, his forces were able to free 67,000 Zairean civilians taken as hostage and used as human shields by the Interahamwe [Rwandan Hutu militias] in Mugunga, Sake, Tango and Kibumba. He also announced the opening of a humanitarian corridor under the control of the alliance forces on the Minova-Goma-Gisenyi line. He also recalled the conclusions reached by the various missions sent to Goma and Bukavu on the subject of the nonexistence of Rwandan refugees on the liberated territory. The international community, particularly the French, therefore have no reason to be involved in a problem which has already been solved by separating the intimidators from the genuine refugees, who have gone home en masse. Laurent Kabila believes that France is trying to support the Kinshasa regime instead of actively contributing towards the construction of the country with the support of the ADFLCZ. Following yesterday's [22nd November] visit to Sayo [phonetic] camp, where impressive quantities of arms and ammunition captured from FAZ and FAR had been stockpiled, Kabila confirmed the alliance's position, saying that the international forces could only come to Bukavu and Goma subject to authorization by the alliance. It is worth recalling that the visit of Sayo camp and the sizeable arms stockpile was conducted by Kabila for the international press who had met in Bukavu for that purpose. Here is Mr Kabila on the microphone of Mabele Mwana Kitoko [phonetic]: [Kabila] That is our objective. We are going there, we are going there [repetition as heard] [words indistinct] because that is not their place. They must step aside. [Words indistinct]. [Mabele] Mr Kabila, it is said that there are great projects planned for the region, notably from Americans who would like to replace the French, and that you could be a man for the Americans. What do you say to that? [A] They have never contacted me. I do not know. They have not contacted me. I am nobody's man. I am a man of my people. Who will replace France if it loses influence in the region? Why it is going to lose influence? Well, what I do know is that the Congolese [Zairean] people have no influence in France. [Q] We will talk to you in terms of representatives of great powers. I am talking in terms of aid, cooperation, financial aid - [Kabila, interrupting] And why [words indistinct] of France? It is because it is allied to the devil. That is natural. That must stop. [Q] Nevertheless, (?there is) support for President Mobutu within his family, his ethnic group and even in the interior of Zaire. He is still popular, don't you think? [A] Among a tiny minority. He is not popular at all. It is a tiny, insignificant minority. [Q] However, there is indeed Zairean national pride which was hurt with what took place here in Kivu. There is talk of (?remorse) in Kinshasa - [Kabila, interrupting] That is an interpretation. A politicized interpretation by the media, people who have an interest in supporting Mobutu, and that is all. [Q] However, you are an exception Mr Kabila. You have a piece of Zairean territory of which you are the president [words indistinct]. [A] No, no, no, I am not a president of anything. [Q] In any case, you do not recognize the leadership in Kinshasa. [A] We do not recognize it, because what is the leadership in Kinshasa. It is illegal. It is not a legal leadership. It is a group of gangsters who seized power. There is no constitution. So, them and me, it is [words indistinct]. [Q] So, you have to achieve legitimacy. [A] Well, popular legitimacy. Because all you are seeing [here] are not career soldiers. We did not recruit them, we do not pay them. It is the people with arms against an oppressive regime. [Q] It appears as if President Mobutu would like to see you in Nice. [A] In Nice? No, here, in Africa, not in Nice. In his chateau? [Q] For example. [A] Why? [Q] And if he asked you to go and have talks with him to participate in a national unity government? [A] It is understandable for there to be discussions with him, and that is good. That is the way we think of things. We must have talks, to stop violence. It is them who do not want to stop violence. They do not want to lose power.

./samples/,"Retiring chairman Frank Daniels Jr. bid farewell to member publishers and editors of The Associated Press at the news cooperative's annual meeting, ending a five-year term that saw AP innovations in digital photography, advertising technology and online service. Daniels, who has been a member of the AP board of directors since 1983 and chairman since 1992, retired earlier this year as president and publisher of the News & Observer of Raleigh, N.C. ""I believe that AP is in the forefront of innovation - assisting our members without in any way conflicting with them,"" he said. ""Next year we're going to be celebrating our 150 years of existence, and in my judgment, The Associated Press continues to grow and improve each year."" Louis D. Boccardi, AP president and chief executive officer, thanked Daniels. ""He is really a remarkable man and I have learned immensely from him - about business, about the news business, and about human nature. He's cheered our successes and encouraged us to try again when we failed,"" Boccardi said. Also at the April 28 meeting, election results from all-mail voting showed that John W. Madigan, chairman, president and chief executive officer of the Tribune Co., and Lissa Walls Vahldiek, vice president and chief operating officer of Southern Newspapers Inc., won seats on the AP's board of directors. Five incumbents were re-elected: John J. Curley, chairman, president and CEO of Gannett Co., representing The News Journal of Wilmington, Del.; Donald E. Newhouse, president of The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J.; Mary Schurz, editor and publisher of The Advocate-Messenger of Danville, Ky.; George W. Wilson, president of the Concord (N.H.) Monitor; and, representing a city under 50,000 population, Gregg K. Jones, co-publisher of The Greeneville (Tenn.) Sun. Boccardi and Newhouse, the chairman-elect, pointed to the success of AP developments such as an online photo archive, AP StocksExpress, a paginated stock service for smaller newspapers, and AdSEND, a digital advertising delivery service. Boccardi also offered a live demonstration of The WIRE, AP's online service for members, which made its debut in October 1996. Those developments notwithstanding, Newhouse said, Daniels will be remembered for his ""special combination of wit and wisdom that are the mark of one of our industry's leading figures."" Boccardi also moderated a panel discussion with AP reporters from around the world about recent developments in Washington politics, the Middle East and ethnic unrest in Africa. Panelists were Nairobi-based newswoman Karin Davies, AP vice president and special correspondent Walter R. Mears, Israel chief of bureau Nicolas Tatro, Washington, D.C., special assignment editor John Solomon and White House reporter Sonya Ross. Davies told the emotionally gripping story of being held last Halloween along with a photographer by government forces in Zaire and told to ""live your last moments. You're going to die."" They were freed hours later. Davies prompted a round of laughter with her story about deciding not to tell her mother that she was covering war-torn Africa. The truth came out after her photographer was wounded and a photo of her cradling the bloody man was printed in her hometown paper, The Seattle Times. A friend called her mother to say her daughter was in the paper, Davies explained, ""And my mother said, 'Oh, at Wimbledon?""' Tatro spoke of the fear of bombings he and his family must endure every day in Jerusalem. He recounted the story of his son asking whether a public bus his class was taking to the zoo would explode. ""I said with more assurance than I felt that it wouldn't,"" Tatro said. ""It leaves everyone with a sense of insecurity about whether to go to the mall or whether to go out to a walk in a crowded place."" Mears, who has traveled with seven presidents, said press access to the president has narrowed steadily over the years, thanks to an ""on-guard sense"" from politicians that comes from every word and action being recorded and dissected for public consumption. Ross said first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is far more accessible on trips than her husband. ""She comes back to the press quarters of the plane to commiserate over the day, to talk about some things that she may have on her mind, to see pictures that photographers took on the laptop,"" she said. ""He is on a larger plane; it's more difficult for him to come back."" Solomon noted that the White House has been unusually vigorous in turning over newsmaking documents related to the controversy over Democratic political fund-raising tactics. The strategy appears to be to release the documents before Republicans uncover them and to inundate Americans with so much information that they become less interested in the controversy, Solomon said. --- Madigan, Vahldiek elected to AP board CHICAGO (AP) - John W.

Hamelers also points out that Botswana housed the biggest underground United States nuclear base on its territory during the Mozambican, Angolan and Namibian conflicts. It's expected that this US military build-up will play a ""bizarre role"" [preceding two words in Dutch] in future southern African conflicts. International political experts point out that the military build-up in Botswana is part of a worldwide US strategy to entrench regional governments, about which 'Patriot'has reported in the past. Hamelers also points out that South Africa, after obtaining permission from the US government, delivered loads of weapons to Rwanda during the past few months with the deliberate aim of destabilizing the region. Zaire's President Mabuto is seriously ill, and there are doubts whether he will, especially under current circumstances, be able to return to his country. The arms supply forms part of the US and EU strategy to topple the Mabuto regime since that government seems to be hindering the establishment of a southern African regional government. In Europe, all governments have pushed aside decisions on Zaire and Rwanda as they awaited the US presidential election results. Now that Bill Clinton has been elected to serve another term, everyone is waiting for him to take the lead in southern Africa. About two or three months ago, 'Patriot' reported the sale of upgraded US F-16 aircraft to Botswana, and the purchase of Leopard tanks, first from Germany, and after that transaction had fallen through, from the Netherlands. The transaction still has not materialized. The F-16s were bought at a relatively low price from a NATO country, Turkey. Turkey, a US ally, used these aircraft to attack fellow Muslims, and 15 million Kurds in Iraq, with the approval of the United States. Spokesmen at Botswana's embassies in Pretoria denied that the US government was involved in a power build-up and that it had a nuclear base in Botswana. US spokesmen at the Pretoria embassy were not available to comment and answer questions in this regard at the time of printing this issue of 'Patriot'.","""1996-11-23T00:00:00Z""","""3S4Y-DTB0-0017-G52C-00000-00"""

Kabila invited the envoy, Mohamed Sahnoun, to a rally celebrating the rebel capture last weekend of Kisangani, Zaire's third-largest city. ""Do you want a cease-fire?"" Kabila asked. The crowd of 5,000 booed, hissed and shouted, ""No!"" ""Keep on going, keep on going,"" they cried. ""Freedom! Freedom!"" Kabila promised, ""This movement will continue until Gbadolite, until Kinshasa."" Mobutu's home village is in Gbadolite in northern Zaire where he has built a palatial residence. Sahnoun is trying to persuade the warring factions to lay down their arms before fighting ignites the whole region. Kabila has repeatedly said he won't quit until Mobutu resigns. The ailing president returned to Kinshasa on Friday from France but has not been seen in public. Mobutu reportedly has internal bleeding linked to his prostate cancer surgery in August. On Saturday, he was reported to be resting at one of his residences at Camp Tshatshi on the outskirts of Kinshasa, 800 miles west of Kisangani. ""We talked and talked and nothing worked. Gunfire is the only language Mobutu understands,"" Kabila said. ""There won't be a cease-fire before negotiations. That is it."" The rebels have captured a third of Zaire in six months and continue to make steady gains. Kabila said his troops in southern Zaire are now just 125 miles from Lumbumbashi, the country's second-largest city, and moving toward the diamond-trading city of Mbuji-Mayi. At the rally, Kabila also announced the suspension of political parties until the war ends. He said a transitional government will be formed exclusively by his rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire. ""We are in the process of liberation. If we accept political parties, they will tell lies to stop the advance of the Alliance,"" Kabila said. No one complained - at least not openly - around the ruling.

./samples/,"High-level delegates at a summit here Thursday were hoping to come up with a date for negotiations between Zaire's warring parties. Delegations from Kinshasa's transitional government and Laurent-Desire Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire held separate closed-door consultations with Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, the host of the summit organised by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim, United Nations chief Kofi Annan and the two organisations' joint envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mohamed Sahnoun, were also present during some of these consultations. By mid-afternoon Thursday, most of the 15 African heads of state who took part in the summit had left the capital, leaving other delegates and the pr ess wondering whether the summit was still in session. session. The heads of state signed a final declaration Wednesday evening endorsing a peace plan very similar to the five-point initiative drawn up by Sahnoun in February. Earlier Thursday the alliance delegates said peace talks would be held ""within a very few days."" The two Zairean delegations met for the first time Wednesday evening in Eyadema's suite at the February 2 hotel in Lome, named after the date in 1974 when the president returned home unscathed after an aircraft accident. Another direct encounter between the delegations was expected to take place later Thursday. Apart from the promise of imminent negotiations, many delegates here felt one of the greatest achievements of the summit was to weave together separate efforts for peace in Zaire. The summit has led to ""a confuence of initiatives,"" said Michel Dupuch, advisor on African affairs to President Jacques Chirac of France. Dupuch added he was pleased efforts were now concentrated on the Sahnoun plan. Most observers also agreed the Lome talks gave the Tutsi-led rebel alliance the recognition and credibility it sought. ""The most important thing about (the summit) was that it allowed us to tell the world the realities of what is happening in our country,"" alliance delegate Bizima Karaha said at a press conference Thursday. Photographers, TV cameramen and reporters engulfed the rebel delegation whenever they emerged from closed door sessions. The summit could also lead to a thawing of relations between Nigeria and its neighbour Cameroon. The two states have been squabbling over the ownership of the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula for several years. The two country's presidents, Sani Abacha and Paul Biya, met face to face Thursday--in Eyadema's suite--embraced each other and exchanged pleasantries. France, still a major influence in west and central Africa, praised Thursday steps at an African summit in Togo towards peace talks in Zaire. Meanwhile, the refugee situation in eastern Zaire remained dramatic. Hungry, sick and worn out, Rwandan Hutu refugees were trekking Thursday by the thousands on the road to Kisangani, after a weekend attack that left many of them dead or wounded. Men and women with kitbags on their heads, children in tattered clothes, babies strapped to their mothers' backs--all could be seen walking northwards to the rebel-held city on the Zaire River. Some also bore apparent gunshot and mortar wounds, sustained they said in an attack overnight Saturday, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Kisangani. In Moscow, Russia announced Thursday that it was evacuating its diplomats from Zaire and that a representative from the ministry of emergency situations had arrived in the country to organize the operation. A spokesman for the ministry told AFP that the foreign ministry had given its accord in principle for the evacuation, which could also include other Russian nationals. so/jz/jhb/msa AFP Zaire's government and rebels fighting to topple it will hold talks in the next few days, a rebel official said here Thursday.

The official, Bizima Karaha, mentioned Togo and South Africa as possible venues for the talks but did not say exactly when they might start. There was no confirmation from the government, which until has been demanding a ceasefire before any talks with the mainly Tutsi guerrillas who in six months have seized about a quarter of the vast central African country. Still, Karaha insisted: ""this is the first time people from Kinshasa decided to agree on starting"" negotiations. He said they would start in ""very few days."" Karaha is one of two men representing Laurent-Desire Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire at an African summit here in the capital of Togo. Asked where the peace talks might take place, he said: ""There are countries which say they have a sufficient interest in the search for a peaceful solution in our country. We are ready to go to many of these countries. One of these countries is South Africa...but there is also Togo."" He added: ""We are ready to go in any country as long as those Zaireans are serious."" And of the government side he said: ""Of course I have to mention that we don't trust them much because they are known for giving so many promises but we shall wait until such a time that they have fulfilled their commitment."" Karaha was in the Togolese capital for a summit of 14 African heads of state called by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to address the crisis in Zaire. It was to continue Thursday. On Wednesday, both of Kabila's delegates shook hands with representatives of the Kinshasa government during an audience with President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo. But Karaha stressed negotiations would not take place with these men. ""We are not here for negotiations. These people who are here, the majority do not represent anyone...neither the government nor the people of Zaire. We cannot negotiate with people who have no mandate,"" he said. Lokongo Bobiloko, deputy speaker of parliament, is here to represent the government of Kinshasa. Earlier Wednesday the two warring sides took part in the summit proper, marking the first time since the rebellion began in October that delegates of the two sides had come together in the same room. Kabila's mainly Tutsi guerrillas took up arms after accusing President Mobutu Sese Seko of trying to deny them Zairean citizenship and expel them to Rwanda, their ancestral homeland. Rebel officials have turned down an offer from Mobutu's political party to share power in Kinshasa, saying they want to bring down his 30-year regime, widely blamed for abject poverty in a country with a bounty of natural resources. afm/dw AFP afp","""1997-03-27T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-3H90-0025-F0BX-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Rebel leader Laurent Kabila and President Mobutu Sese Seko agree they will meet one another, but the rebels said Tuesday there is only one thing to discuss: Mobutu's departure from power. U.S. envoy Bill Richardson talked with Kabila for three hours Tuesday night in this southeastern city. Both parties have agreed to meet, he said, but details about the venue and date remain unresolved. ""As you heard Kabila say, he's agreed to face-to-face talks. Mobutu has agreed to face-to-face talks. They are ready to proceed as soon as possible, this weekend or earlier,"" Richardson said. South Africa has offered to have the talks held on one of its naval supply ships, which would be anchored in international waters off the coast of Zaire and Angola. Richardson appeared tired as he spoke with reporters on the steps of the Karavia Hotel, on the outskirts of Lubumbashi. Earlier in the day, he had been in the capital, Kinshasa, in western Zaire, to talk with Mobutu. The blunt-talking ambassador to the United Nations pressed Mobutu to accept that he cannot stop the rebels and urged him to agree to immediate peace talks. ""There can be no military solution to this crisis,"" Richardson said. The ambassador was to return to Kinshasa on Wednesday for further talks with Mobutu. Before meeting with Richardson, Kabila's foreign affairs minister said there would be one chance at talks - and that they would be brief because the only topic would be the end of Mobutu's 32-year dictatorship. ""We are not going there to discuss a cease-fire,"" Bizima Karaha told reporters. ""We are going there to discuss the end of the war, a complete end of the war. And a complete end of the war can only come about when the man who brought the war is no longer there."" Furthermore, the rebels - who have seized more than half of Africa's third-largest nation in seven months - will not stop their offensive while waiting for a settlement, he said. Tuesday morning, the rebels easily captured Kikwit, a city on a major highway only 250 miles east of the capital, Karaha said. ""The next stop is Kinshasa,"" he said. The United States is pushing strongly for a cease-fire and negotiations leading to an inclusive transitional government, Richardson said. Then, the United States would like to see Zairians hold elections, he said. During the talks in Lubumbashi, Richardson sat next to Kabila at a large circular table, flanked by Karaha; the U.S. ambassador to Zaire, Daniel Simpson; and other Washington delegates. About eight reporters waited outside the talks, held in a back room of the rebel leader's Spanish colonial-style villa. Kabila declined to speak with reporters after the session. Mobutu, 66, has insisted he would never bow to Kabila's demand he resign, but he is under increasing pressure. He is ill with prostate cancer, Western powers have urged him to give up, and the political opposition within Zaire is gaining momentum with each rebel victory. In Kinshasa, Mobutu appeared briefly with Richardson on the veranda of his residence and shook the U.S. envoy's hand but made no statement. Richardson refused to discuss his conversation with Mobutu, saying only: ""We were both very frank. I carried a strong message.""","""1997-04-29T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8DK0-000Y-K4HV-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila was in the rebel-held town of Kisangani Sunday meeting with U.N. and other officials to personally iron out the refugee crisis in his territory. Kabila reportedly met with U.N. special envoy to the Great Lakes, Aldo Ajello, as well as Western diplomats and his own top aides to discuss the plight of over 80,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees, who have now abandoned their camps and vanished into thick surrounding forest, following clashes with Zairean villagers and soldiers this week. Aid officials welcomed Kabila's hands-on approach, and said it would present an opportunity to straighten out the current crisis. Kabila has pledged to try and get to the root of the problem, and find a lasting solution. Kabila and his rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire have come under scathing attack by the international community after blocking aid workers from reaching refugee in their camps. The refugees later fled into the bush. The United States, also concerned about the situation in Zaire, is sending Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to the region. The White House said in a statement Saturday that the ambassador ""will press both sides to agree to halt the fighting and launch serious negotiations to form an inclusive transitional government leading to free and fair democratic elections"". It was unclear when Richardson would travel to Africa. He would also deal with the issue of the violation of human rights and the situation of refugees in eastern Zaire, the White House said. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday criticized the rebels, and said he feared the Rwandan Hutu refugees were the ""victims of a policy of slow extermination."" Aid agencies are alarmed at the seeming disappearance of the refugees, thousands of whom were in no condition to walk, suffering from malnutrition, exhaustion, cholera and other ailments. A U.N. team that flew Friday over the Kasese 1 and 2 camps which had housed 55,000 refugees, and the Biaro camp that had held 30,000 refugees, said both camps were completely empty and they had only seen a few dozen stragglers along the main road headed south. On Saturday the U.N. refugee agency flew food and medicine to some 300 refugees who have arrived at Ubundu, 100 kilometers south of Kisangani, and the U.N. World Food Program said it planned to send in supplies by train. A few of the refugees have turned up in Kisangani after three days of walking. They spoke of attacks which left several refugees dead at the Kasese camp by local Zairean villagers wielding knives and machetes. However, when a U.N. assessment team explored the Kasese camps last Thursday, they found no trace of anyone - dead or alive. There was a fresh mound of earth, possibly indicating a mass grave, but they were unable to investigate it further because of gunfire around the camp. The peace process in Zaire got a fresh breath of air when Gabon said Zaire's ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko agreed to meet rebel leader Kabila for face-to-face talks in the Gabonese capital Libreville. A statement from Gabon's President Omar Bongo said he was waiting for Kabila's response, and that any talks would take place under the chairmanship of South African President Nelson Mandela. Mandela had invited the two leaders for talks in South Africa, but that plan failed when Mobutu's son said Zaire's president was still recovering from prostate cancer treatment and the journey to South Africa was too strenuous. However, Mobutu and Kabila are still at odds over the purpose of such a personal meeting. Mobutu says he wants to negotiate a way toward democratic elections, while Kabila says he'll only attend the meeting if Mobutu is ready to hand over power. dpa eg","""1997-04-27T00:00:00Z""","""3RPR-R7H0-0094-N0P1-00000-00"""

President Mobutu Sese Seko did not announce his resignation, as had been expected. UN envoy Mohamed Sahnoun said that rebel leader Laurent Kabila agreed before the meeting to a temporary ceasefire as a ""gesture of good will,''  but it was not clear whether the truce continued or indeed if it ever began. Kabila's rebels, who already control three-quarters of Zaire, are reportedly pushing toward the capital, Kinshasa. During a news conference with a grim-faced Mobutu and smiling Kabila, Sahnoun said aboard a South African naval ship docked in this port city that South African President Nelson Mandela, who was helping to mediate the talks, would reconvene another meeting between the two rivals in six to 10 days to narrow the gap between them. Sahnoun said Mobutu proposed a ceasefire and a transitional government that would prepare the Central African country for its first multiparty elections. --- NEW YORK - IBM's Deep Blue computer defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov on Sunday, tying their six-game series at one game apiece.

Annan said the United Nations, in close cooperation with the countries of the region, is hoping to persuade the warring parties to form a coalition government of all forces involved in the conflict. ''We have not given up hope of getting the parties to accept some sort of a transitional arrangement and therefore avoid bloody conflict in the capital city,''  Annan said at a news conference in Moscow. ''I'm quite hopeful that we will be able to avoid bloodshed in Kinshasa.''  The 56-year-old rebel leader whose troops entered the capital of Zaire after an eight-month westward sweep across the country, pledged to form a transitional government by Tuesday and issue a new constitution within 60 days. But he made no mention of elections that the United States has pressed him to organize. France, which for decades helped prop up the regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko, who left the capital on Friday, expressed its displeasure that a negotiated solution did not prevail in Zaire. France was waiting for the ''new leaders''  quickly to establish a transition, involving all political forces, to ''democratic and transparent''  elections, a Foreign Ministry statement said. ''We will be very attentive to the actions of the new authorities....''We consider the new authorities responsible from now on for security in Kinshasa as in the rest of the country, as well as for the protection of foreign communities,''  the ministry said. France, Spain and Britain said they had no immediate plans to evacuate their nationals from the country. Britain said the situation in Kinshasa was very far from settled, but hoped there would not be a breakdown in law and order. ''We see it as an opportunity for change and a new start for the people of Zaire,''  a Foreign Ministry spokesman said anonymously. ''We hope it signals an early end to the violence of the past month and restoration of stability in the country as a whole.''  He said Britain was looking for a ''comprehensive and inclusive process to for all the people of Zaire.''  Spain, too, said it hoped the entry of rebel troops into Kinshasa and the rebel proclamation signified ''peace and stability with the installation of a government of full national consensus,''  the state news agency EFE reported. There are no plans to evacuate the 390 Spanards in Zaire, including 160 in Kinshasa, the foreign ministry said. (buros-acw)","""1997-05-17T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-5KP0-00BT-M39R-00000-00"""

Speaking after a meeting with Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the former guerrilla leader also expressed support for the new government of the Congo, urging its leaders to move toward a multi-party system and economic partnership with neighboring countries. The Congo has huge economic potential, he said, and ''we all support the government of President (Laurent) Kabila and will do all we can to see democracy, peace and stability return''  to the former Zaire. Nujoma also urged Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi to take advantage of the presence of a U.N. peace-keeping force to play an active role in politics rather than stay in his provincial stronghold. Angola recently installed a unity government but Savimbi has yet to appear in Luanda. ''We were in exile,''  the gray-bearded leader said of the experience of his own South West Africa People's Organization, which struggled against South African rule from 1960 until 1990. After liberation, he said, ''We didn't return to our villages. We went to the capital and participated.''  Asked about the crushing debt of many African countries, Nujoma said: ''We Africans, we just have to reorganize ourselves. We shouldn't cry like babies. And we have huge resources.

./samples/,"Talks on the formation of a new government of the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire, continued into the night Wednesday with no immediate announcement expected, officials said. A senior policy advisor to Laurent Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), Babi Mbayi, said the government would be announced piecemeal, with the ministries to be filled by ADFL personnel announced first, probably Thursday. The official said the greater part of the portfolios would go to the rebel alliance. Kabila, the self-proclaimed president whose rebel forces ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and took control of the capital last weekend, was expected to hold talks with popular opposition figure Etienne Tshisekedi late Wednesday, but there was no official confirmation whether they had taken place. The popular Tshisekedi, 64, a former prime minister who leads the main opposition Union for Social Progress party, is expected to be a pivotal figure in the interim government, and has been widely tipped for the role of prime minister. minister. But his role in Kabila's administration was still uncertain. Asked by reporters if he would indeed be nominated as Kabila's prime minister, Mbayi said: ""He can always ask."" Kabila has come under international pressure, in particular from the United States, to include Tshisekedi in his government to ensure a broad-based democratic appeal after more than three decades of autocratic rule by the deposed Mobutu, who has gone into exile. ""We expect Tshisekedi to be included but the whole question is what role he will have,"" said a US official in Washington. The US ambassador to Kinshasa, Daniel Simpson, held discussions with various political factions earlier in the day, the official said. Kabila had been due to name his interim government on Tuesday, within a promised three days from Saturday, but reportedly delayed the announcement until after talks between his officials and Tshisekedi. Marshal Mobutu meanwhile was still in the Togolese capital of Lome. But the ousted dictator, who is recovering from surgery for prostate cancer, was reportedly too sick to receive his old friend and current host President Gnassingbe Eyadema. More than 90 members of Mobutu's family and entourage arrived Wednesday afternoon in N'Djamena, the capital of Chad, reporters there observed. Among them were the dictator's elder sister and her husband General Boluzi, head of the gendarmerie under the Mobutu regime. The whole group was put up in one of the capital's hotels, the Tchadienne (Chadian), near to which Mobutu owns a villa. Mobutu, ""health permitting,"" is expected to make the trip to N'Djamena later with his doctors. However, officials indicated that the group's stay in the country was only provisional until they could find a country prepared to host them permanently. European representatives of the new regime in Kinshasa said that they had asked France not to grant exile to the ousted leader, who is accused of pillaging billions of dollars from state coffers. They also requested authorities to seize his luxury villa near Monaco on the French Riviera. ""We are appealing solemnly to the French government,"" Leonard She Okitundu, a member of the Geneva-based European Alliance office, told a press briefing. If Paris grants exile to its former ally there will be ""consequences now that we're in power,"" he warned. A French government official in Paris said Tuesday Mobutu had not requested shelter in France, recalling that Morocco and South Africa had both offered refuge to the exile-seeker. The French government is expected to await the results of the legislative elections May 25 and June 1 before making a decision on the matter. French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said Wednesday evening that a ""democratic transition"" was needed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""If another non-democratic regime succeeds that of Mobutu, where would the progress be?"" he said in a television interview. In the meantime, France's ambassador to Kinshasa Michel Rougagnou has requested an audience with Kabila, which some have interpreted as a de facto recognition of his regime. The purpose of the meeting would be to transmit a message aimed at organising democratic elections, the French foreign ministry said. db/cm/gk Laurent Kabila was expected to usher in the post-Mobutu era with the announcement of his new government Wednesday as he attempted to make the transition from jungle guerrilla to statesman. Kabila flew into Kinshasa under darkness late Tuesday accompanied by a plane carrying senior members of his alliance, including the top officials for foreign affairs and finance. Kabila immediately established his headquarters in the residence of former prime minister Likulia Bolongo, who fled the country as Kabila's rebels advanced on the capital at the weekend. The immediate area, on the Congo River in Kinshasa's residential Gombe district, has been sealed off since his arrival in the capital of what used to be Zaire. Kabila has renamed the country the Democratic Republic of Congo. Kabila had been due to name his interim government on Tuesday, within a promised 72 hours from Saturday, following the defeat of Mobutu's forces by Kabila's rebel army which sent the ousted Zairean president into exile in Togo. But according to local press reports Wednesday, Kabila delayed the announcement until after a meeting between the alliance and former prime minister Etienne Tshisekedi. The self-appointed president is under enormous popular and diplomatic pressure to hand 64-year-old Tshisekedi the role of prime minister of his new administration, but a deal with the long-time political heavyweight had yet to be cut by late Tuesday. The Alliance Secretary General Deogratias Bugera was due to hold talks with Tshisekedi on Tuesday, but the meeting was postponed for apparent protocol reasons, newspapers here quoting diplomatic sources said. Newspaper editorials have been urging Kabila to bring Tshisekedi aboard a broad-based government. Tshisekedi, who leads the main opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress, was a consistent thorn in the side of deposed despot Mobutu Sese Seko, after splitting with him in the 1980s to found his own party. He flew to the French Riviera to meet the convalescing Mobutu at his villa last November, afterwards declaring himself head of a national unity government. He was appointed to succeed sacked prime minister Kengo Wa Dondo last month, but was forced to stand down almost immediately. Diplomatic and public opinon here Wednesday appeared to suggest that no properly balanced government can be formed without him. However Kabila's top finance official, Mawampanga Mwana Nanga, told reporters before leaving Lubumbashi with Kabila that the new government would exclude Mobutu supporters. ""It will not include political parties,"" he added, with all members of the new government being chosen as individuals. But Mawampanga said political parties would ""definitely"" be allowed to contest upcoming elections, which he said would be held ""within 12 months."" Governments around the world have rushed to recognise Kabila as head of state and to acknowledge the Democratic Republic of Congo, the new name for Zaire. db/jp/dw Belgium Wednesday granted de facto recognition to the new regime in its former colony, the Democratic Republic of Congo.

./samples/,"Peace talks between Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila were called off today after Kabila objected to the location of the meeting The talks - seen as the last hope of avoiding a bloody battle for the Zairian capital - had been scheduled to take place today on board a South African naval ship. But delays related to Kabila's arrival led first to a postponement of the meeting, then cancellation. ""We have had a communication a little while ago that Mr. Kabila will not be coming to Pointe-Noire,"" said U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun. The plan had called for the meeting to take place while the ship was docked at Pointe-Noire, and South African officials said Kabila had been aware of the arrangement for days and had agreed. Sahoun said Kabila today demanded the ship set sail and be in international waters before he boarded. ""There was a telephone from President Mandela in which he asked that the ship should go to the high seas,"" Sahnoun told reporters, referring to the South African president who was to chair the talks. ""President Mandela reminded him that he had already agreed that he should come to Pointe-Noire. President Mandela said the ship will not go to the high sea for the meeting, and therefore the meeting will not be held,"" he said. Mobutu, looking frail, arrived in Pointe-Noire earlier in the day and got into a motorcade headed for the harbor. A top Kabila aide, Moise Nyarugabo, said the rebel alliance also had received information that Kabila could be in danger on or near the ship. He did not elaborate. The talks had taken on a sense of urgency, with rebel troops closing in on the capital, although the rebels had pledged to slow their advance for the duration. Rebel radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., said the fighters were ""slowing down their advance to Kinshasa for political and strategic reason."" But a Western diplomat and Zairian military officials, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebels had reached the Black River, 60 miles outside Kinshasa and the last major defensive position before the capital. The increasingly unpopular government called on civilians to help the army defend Kinshasa. Kinshasa was quiet, both because of a nightly 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew imposed Tuesday and because of a general strike called by opposition parties in an attempt to increase the pressure on Mobutu to resign. The strike was widely observed, giving the impression of a lazy Sunday afternoon in the usually loud, chaotic city of 5 million. Markets were deserted and streets empty except for children playing soccer and people out for a stroll. Julien Boketshu, 26, said the calm was a sign that people believe Mobutu will go. ""We are waiting for Mobutu to resign because we have suffered for many years,"" he said. ""That's why we don't protest. We are waiting for it to happen."" Long supermarket lines indicated that some residents were stocking up on groceries. Plainclothes police roamed downtown, stopping people to demand bribes. A leaflet circulating on the streets urged civilians and soldiers to fly white flags and sing ""songs of joy"" in support of the rebels. The curfew was a sign of the government's growing edginess about the rebel advance. In many other cities, civilians and soldiers have gone on major looting sprees before fleeing Kabila's force. Even if Mobutu agreed to a peaceful handover of power to Kabila, there are fears troops in the loyal presidential guard would want to grab whatever they could before being forced to surrender or flee. A first meeting between Kabila and Mobutu on May 4 left two major issues unresolved: details of a transitional government, and when Mobutu would step down. Mobutu, 66 and ailing with cancer, said he would give up the presidency only after elections. The rebels insist Mobutu surrender power immediately to a transitional authority led by Kabila. Because of Mobutu's lack of support among both civilians and troops, Kabila's army has had a relatively easy time capturing three-quarters of Zaire. Soldiers in most cities have put up little resistance. But as the rebels moved closer to Kinshasa, fighting has increased. The rebels and some foreign diplomats say Mobutu is getting help from mercenaries - a charge the government denies.","""1997-05-14T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-87K0-000Y-K0N5-00000-00"""
./samples/,"By Beatrice Khadige PRETORIA, May 19 (AFP) - South Africa is confident self-proclaimed Zairean president Laurent Kabila is committed to the democratisation of the vast central Africa country he now controls, a South African official said Monday. ""We have no reason to doubt the commitment of Mr. Kabila to the democratisation process,"" Ricky Naidoo, spokesman for Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, told AFP. Mbeki, who played a key role in trying to negotiate a peaceful end to the Zairean civil war, was the first foreign government representative to hold talks with Kabila after the capture of Kinshasa on Saturday by his forces and the earlier flight of president Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila subsequently proclaimed himself president and renamed Zaire the Democratic Republic of the Congo. congo. He also announced that a government of national salvation would be formed by Tuesday, and the convocation within two months of an assembly to draft a new constitution. The talks, late Sunday, took place in the southern Zaire city of Lubumbashi, whereafter Mbeki announced that South Africa would recognise the new regime. Mbeki told reporters when he emerged from the talks that he was convinced the transitional government ""will be broad-based and that it will provide the necessary stability to address the fundamental challenges of change."" Naidoo on Monday stressed that Sunday's talks had been at the request of Kabila. ""Mr. Kabila wanted to brief the deputy president on the latest developments in his country, and to discuss the transformation to democracy,"" he said. Naidoo said the two men had also talked about technical assistance South Africa and other countries could provide for new structures of government in Zaire ""since the former structures have collapsed."" ""The (mediation) efforts of South Africa were worthwhile,"" Naidoo said, ""because the transitional process is under way in Zaire."" Naidoo said Kabila had also managed to persuade Mohamed Sahnoun, the UN and Organisation of African Unity special envoy to Zaire, of his commitment to the democratic process. Sahnoun told reporters after the meeting late Sunday, also in Lubumbashi, that he had held ""very encouraging"" talks with Kabila on ""the future of governance in Zaire, and democracy."" Sahnoun said it appeared ""that the people of Zaire are happy"" to have Kabila take over. Foreign Affairs spokesman Marco Boni said Monday that Mbeki had offered South Africa's assistance to Kabila to facilitate the transformation process in his country. ""We are encouraged by Mr. Kabila's statements with regard to the formation of a transitional government,"" Boni said. The comments by the South African officials contrast with the initial reaction late Saturday of an unnamed Pretoria official who Johannesburg's Sunday Independent newspaper that Kabila's takeover in Kinshasa ""has all the elements of a coup d'etat."" A senior government official told AFP that Pretoria would closely monitor developments in Zaire, especially the transitional process. South Africa's recognition of Kabila's regime opened the way to acknowledgement by a number of other governments, including Iran, Japan and Burundi. Mbeki, who was accompanied to Lubumbashi by Defence Minister Joe Modise and Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, arrived at Waterkloof military airbase near here early Monday, where he briefed President Nelson Mandela on his talks with Kabila. Mandela, whose efforts at mediating a peaceful transfer of power in Zaire won praise from US President Bill Clinton, was at the air base preparing to leave for a three-day state visit to neighbouring Zimbabwe. bmk/br/ss JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (AFP) - Self-proclaimed Zairean president Laurent Kabila will name a multi-party transitional authority on Tuesday night, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said here Monday. Mbeki, who returned to South Africa earlier Monday after holding talks with Kabila late Sunday in the southern Zaire city of Lubumbashi, said he was confident the new Zairean leader was committed to democracy. ""The new government will be announced tomorrow night,"" Mbeki told a press conference at the World Trade Centre here. ""It will be a broad-based government as inclusive as possible of all the political forces."" South Africa, which has already recognised Kabila as head of state, will recognise the new government ""probably on Wednesday,"" Mbeki said. ""There will be a broad-based government,"" he said. ""The political and democratic rights of everyone will be guaranteed. There will be no regulation or banning of the parties."" Mbeki, who played a key role in trying to negotiate a peaceful end to the Zairean civil war, was the first foreign government representative to hold talks with Kabila after the capture of Kinshasa on Saturday by his forces and the earlier flight of president Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila subsequently proclaimed himself president and renamed Zaire the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He also announced that a government of national salvation would be formed by Tuesday, and the convocation within two months of an assembly to draft a new constitution. The talks took place in the southern Zaire city of Lubumbashi, whereafter Mbeki announced that South Africa would recognise Kabila as president. On Monday, Mbeki said he had been assured a process of consultation is taking place with the various leaders of other political parties in Zaire ""and they will tomorrow form the broad-based majority."" ""(Kabila's) alliance has been greatly encouraged by communications they received from the leadership of Mobutu's party that they would be willing to cooperate with the alliance,"" he said. ""There is a general approach of the political players in the country to cooperate during this period of transition."" Mbeki warned that it may be some time before elections are held in Zaire, citing the three years it took South African negotiators to fix a date for elections once they had begun the constitutional talks that finally ended apartheid. ""The main thing now (in Zaire) is the constitutional process,"" he said. Mbeki, quizzed on whether South African attempts to negotiate a peaceful handover of power in Zaire should be regarded as a success, said Mobutu, who fled Kinshasa with his senior aides on Friday, had scuttled Pretoria's peace plan. ""It was unfortunate that Mobutu left in the manner he did,"" Mbeki said. ""There was no president, no acting president, no chief minister, no chief of defence force, no authority of any kind, it was a complete vacuum. ""We had wanted to avoid that kind of situation with the proposals we had made for the handing over of power, which didn't happen because Mobutu abandoned his post and disappeared.""

./samples/,"Walk into Western embassies in Kinshasa and chances are there will be a stack of passports belonging to wealthy Zairians, all looking for an exit. If the stories swirling through the teeming streets of the capital and dark corridors of parliament are true, those closest to President Mobutu Sese Seko have booked 400 hotel rooms across the river in the Congolese capital, Brazzaville, in case they have to flee. And Mobutu's presidential guards are smuggling their families out of town under cover of darkness. With half the country in rebel hands and opposition to Mobutu gaining momentum, the questions in the capital may have changed: It's no longer whether the rebels will reach Kinshasa, but when. And, will it be soon enough to forestall an uprising by soldiers and civilians demanding an end to more than 31 years of bullying and corrupt rule. In public, Mobutu and his backers still perform as if there are battles left for them to fight in a war that most political observers say was lost long ago. A ""major government communique"" read on state-run TV Thursday night denounced an American company's billion-dollar deal to mine copper, cobalt and zinc in rebel-held territory and declared it ""null and void."" Never mind that the government itself is null and void in that part of Zaire and that its word its credibility is in as much jeopardy as the national currency, now trading at 175,000 to the U.S. dollar. The question is whether the cancer-ridden Mobutu, despite his efforts to appear in control, has accepted the reality and is prepared to negotiate his exit before rebel leader Laurent Kabila comes to town. ""He has no choice. He has no army. He has lost the support of the people, There's no money left in the state treasury,"" said Jose Zola Kinkela, secretary-general of the Independent Democratic Union party. ""Kabila will take the country - there's no doubt about it."" Mobutu's best move, say Zola and others, would be to salvage what honor he has left by retiring into foreign exile before he and those linked to his regime are forced to flee. That could involve announcing he will not contest long-promised presidential elections in exchange for Kabila halting his advance on Kinshasa and accepting a transitional government until voting takes place. Despite Kabila's war talk, international persuasion could force him to accept such a scenario, said Valentin Mubake Nombi, an opposition lawmaker who attended negotiations in South Africa last month between government and rebel envoys. ""I think Mr. Kabila has to stop now, because although he's a war chief, he also wants to govern this country. To do this, he has to win over the public opinion, and to do this he has to act as a politician, not a dictator,"" said Mubake. ""The last thing Zairians want is another Mobutu, and the last thing the international community will accept is another Mobutu."" If the 66-year-old ruler refuses to go voluntarily, Western diplomats say he and his confidantes surely will be forced to make a humiliating flight as Kabila closes in. Or Mobutu may die of his disease, an option the stubborn dictator might prefer. In 1991, when international pressure and public discontent forced him to introduce political reforms, he vowed never to be the ex-president of Zaire - only the late president. Kabila claims he'll take Kinshasa within three weeks, which Western diplomats say is reasonable given his army's rate of progress and the momentum it builds by attracting new recruits along the way. Many of the recruits are youngsters with no battlefield training, but others are ex-Zairian soldiers who have changed sides. Reports Friday had the rebel vanguard approaching Kikwit, a city some 240 miles southeast of the capital. The rutted roads have deteriorated like most of the country's infrastructure under Mobutu, and the rainy season has left some stretches impassable. But the rebels have so far tackled such terrain in tanks and trucks during during their seven-month march toward Kinshasa. Estimates of Kabila's strength range from 6,000 men to more than twice that, with about one-third comprised of former government troops. On the government side, the numbers are higher - at least 10,000 to 15,000 in the capital alone - but it's an army with no reason to fight. Poorly paid, equipped and trained for the last decade, Zaire's soldiers are as eager for Mobutu's ouster as civilians. Rather than battling Kabila's men, the army for the most part has looted and retreated, or joined the rebels. Despite rumors that the airport is mined, that Mobutu has issued a hit-list of political enemies and that he has raised a red flag outside his palace to represent the blood he wants to see shed, there's a sense that Kinshasa's fall will be relatively calm and that the only people with anything to fear are those close to Mobutu. Diplomats say they've been swamped with visa applications from the pro-Mobutu elite, many of whom apply to several embassies at once. Most dependents of U.S., South African and other embassy personnel left voluntarily in recent days. The despair that sparked major uprisings in 1991 and 1993, which included attacks on foreigners, is not there this time, say Kinshasa residents who witnessed the upheavals. Rather than seeing the future as hopeless, they say, most soldiers and civilians are glad to see Mobutu's stranglehold on the country drawing to a close - and they're looking forward to whatever comes next.","""1997-04-20T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8HY0-000Y-K073-00000-00"""
./samples/,"U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan arrives in Cape Town Wednesday on his first trip to Africa since assuming office. South Africa is the first stop on a tour that also takes him to Namibia and Angola. Annan will focus on African peace intiatives, development strategies and attempts to establish a human rights culture, U.N. spokesman Yobert Shamapane said Tuesday in a telephone interview from Pretoria. ''I think the timing is significant,''  Shamapane said. ''That he is making this trip within three months of his appointment as secretary general shows the importance he attaches to increasing his understanding of the facts on the ground in Africa.''  Annan, who comes from Ghana, is the first UN secretary general from sub-Saharan Africa. His three-day visit to Cape Town and Johannesburg will include meetings with senior officials such as President Nelson Mandela and Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Desmond Tutu. Shamapande said Annan's discussions with Mandela would focus on South African peace initiatives in Zaire, where rebels took up arms after the government tried to expel ethnic Tutsis from eastern parts of the country. Led by Laurent Kabila, the rebels aim to topple Mobutu, whose 31-year dictatorship has left mineral-rich Zaire among the world's poorest countries. Mandela was involved in last month's South African-based efforts to bring about peace talks between Kabila and Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko's government. Deputy President Thabo Mbeki will represent South Africa at a two-day African heads of state meeting on the Zaire conflict in Nairobi, Kenya, starting Wednesday. Annan and Mandela were also likely to discuss the establishment of a power-sharing government in Angola between the government and UNITA rebels, Shamapande said. Annan is scheduled to attend the planned inauguration of Angola's new government on March 24. After a two-decade civil war, the two sides signed a peace treaty in 1994.

CHANGES dateline) PRETORIA, April 2 (AFP) - Envoys from Zaire's warring sides were due to fly to South Africa on Thursday for face-to-face peace talks this weekend aimed at agreeing a ceasefire to end the country's civil war. Preparations for the highly-anticipated encounter between representatives of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila continued quietly here Wednesday. South African officials revealed few details of the negotiations, expected to start Saturday, which will be chaired by Mohamed Sahnoun, joint envoy for the United Nations and Organisation of African Unity. unity. Zairean charge d'affaires Issa Ganda told AFP an eight-member government delegation, led by Mobutu's envoy Honore Ngabanda Nzambo, will likely arrive in Johannesburg on Thursday on a scheduled Air Zaire flight. The delegation was not expected to take a ""special flight"" because of lack of government funds, Ganda added. ""If they arrive Thursday, there is no reason why negotiations can't begin on Friday or Saturday,"" he said. Zairean rebels in Goma, their stronghold in eastern Zaire, said that South Africa was sending a plane to pick up their delegation Thursday. According to Gaetan Kakudji, deputy secretary general of Kabila's rebel alliance, the rebels would be negotiating ""the departure of Mobutu and his clique,"" not to take on the mantle of the main political opposition to his regime. ""As soon as we reach an accord (with Mobutu's regime), any ceasefire will be automatic,"" Kakudji said. Sahnoun was due to meet South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki on Wednesday to set the stage for the talks, according to a senior diplomat, although Mbeki aides did not confirm the meeting. Rebel forces have captured the eastern quarter of Zaire since they began their offensive in October, and have vowed to topple Mobutu's regime. South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) on Wednesday welcomed the talks, calling on ""all parties to place the interests of the people of the country first and seek a solution that will bring about peace, development and democracy to Congo/Zaire."" In a statement, the ANC said it ""strongly believes Africans must themselves take a lead in the resolution of conflict in the continent,"" adding it hoped the talks in South Africa would be ""meaningful and successful."" Preparations for the talks have been shrouded in secrecy. Officials say the ""very sensitive"" initiative might be jeopardised by publicity. A senior diplomat close to the initiative told AFP Wednesday that the talks would be held in Pretoria on Saturday. A South African foreign ministry spokesman, however, declined to confirm a date or venue for an encounter, telling AFP only that logistical arrangements for the talks were proceeding. The diplomat interviewed by AFP said he was relatively optimistic that a ceasefire would be negotiated, and that, in his opinion, the most difficult challenge for mediators lay in convincing both Zairean factions to consider the best interests of their country. South Africa is one of the so-called ""peace quartet"" that also includes Cameroon, Kenya and Zimbabwe, which was appointed at a November summit of African leaders in Nairobi to guide the peace initiative. The planned talks follow extensive diplomacy by Mbeki, who held meetings with Kabila and African heads of state in Nairobi last week before heading to Kinshasa to meet Mobutu, and South African President Nelson Mandela. bur/gam/km AFP PRETORIA, April 2 (AFP) - Envoys from Zaire's warring sides were due to fly to South Africa on Thursday for face-to-face peace talks this weekend aimed at agreeing a ceasefire to end the country's civil war.

Kakudji said that opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, who Wednesday agreed to become Zaire's new prime minister after the resignation of Kengo wa Dondo, was now ""on the side of the enemy."" ""How can we consider that a gesture of an ally, when he places himself on the side of the enemy? This means that Tshisekedi has chosen his camp,"" he said. Another rebel spokesman, Raphael Ghenda, said ""Does a prime minister under Mobutu's regime have any power? He has no power! By accepting that post, he has become part of Mobutu's regime. If he does Mobutu's politics, we will fight him."" Ghenda also said the rebels would reject the presence of international observers at future elections. ""We can organise free and democratic elections without anyone's help,"" he said. Rebel forces have captured the eastern quarter of Zaire since they began their offensive in October, and have vowed to topple Mobutu's regime. Political parties have been banned in all rebel-controlled territory, and the rebel alliance has said a one-year transitional government would be formed ""exclusively"" from the rebel ranks. There would be no power-sharing. At the end of a year, the rebels said they would allow political parties to resume their activities. For its part, the United Nations said Tuesday it was ready to deploy 100 liaison officers should a ceasefire come into effect, to be followed later by a strengthened observation team for a two- or three-month period. bur/rmb/job AFP afp","""1997-04-02T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-3FX0-0025-F2CF-00000-00"""

Although fighting continued early today on the outskirts of Lubumbashi, Kabila declared a three-day ""pause"" in his military advance to await a call from the capital indicating President Mobutu Sese Seko will resign. ""In three days, if we will not get good news from Kinshasa of his willingness to depart to the north, then we will be forced to continue the military advance,"" Kabila told reporters at a news conference at his Goma headquarters. The rebel leader, who has captured one-third of Zaire since September, refused to elaborate on his ultimatum, saying only: ""The loser is him if he doesn't take our advice."" U.N. staff reported gunfire and explosions in the general direction of the Lumumbashi airport, spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt said in New York.

The new prime minister, Gen. Likulia Bolongo, went to the presidential palace in Kinshasa today in full military uniform to meet with Mobutu but made no comments to reporters. Likulia also plans to meet later in the day with the U.S. ambassador, Daniel Simpson. Kinshasa, in western Zaire, is the only major city still under Mobutu's control. And Mobutu's hold on power appeared to crumble further Wednesday, after his decision to oust popular opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi from the post of prime minister sparked riots in the capital. The United States has urged Mobutu, 66 and ill with prostate cancer, to make way for a democratic government. White House spokesman Mike McCurry on Wednesday called Mobutu's three-decade dictatorship ""a creature of history."" Kabila, meeting with journalists early today in the Goma palace that once belonged to Mobutu, welcomed the U.S. statement. ""Everybody knows that this is the time for Mr. Mobutu to get out of power,"" Kabila said. He added that the rebels had no indication Mobutu plans to resign, though Kabila repeated demands he do so before any cease-fire. Mobutu would be allowed to return to his home village, the northern town of Gbadolite, but Kabila has said he would not be permitted a role in politics. Belgium aligned itself with the United States today, declaring that Mobutu has no political future and calling his new government a military dictatorship. Foreign Minister Erik Derycke urged U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun to broker a transitional government until elections can be held. Mobutu named Likulia, a former defense minister and army chief of staff, as prime minister Wednesday. The four-star general immediately promised a crackdown on civil liberties, saying his primary goal was ""the restoration of public order."" Likulia also said measures would be taken against the media for any articles that ""affected the morale of the military."" Several foreign journalists, including an Associated Press photographer and APTV cameraman, were beaten and had their cameras seized Wednesday by soldiers during an anti-government demonstration in Kinshasa. Kabila said Mobutu's ouster of Tshisekedi was a desperate act to cling to power after the rebels' latest victory - winning the copper- and cobalt-rich city of Lubumbashi, 950 miles southeast of Kinshasa. The city fell Wednesday morning, Kabila said, although fierce fighting between rebel troops and an elite group of Zairian forces continued on its outskirts. With Lubumbashi's fall, the rebels control the second- and third-largest cities - they took No. 3 Kisangani nearly a month ago - and Zaire's top sources of income. Minerals pulled from the rich soil near Lubumbashi provide about 80 percent of Zaire's $300 million in annual export earnings. The rebels also captured the diamond center of Mbuji-Mayi last Friday. Kabila said appointing Tshisekedi - the popular opposition leader - as prime minister last week was a failed attempt by Mobutu to play the opposition in Kinshasa off the rebel movement in eastern Zaire. ""Everyone sees there is chaos in Kinshasa,"" Kabila said, adding that Tshisekedi ""fell into the net of Mr. Mobutu and now he is kicked out."" That does not mean, however, that the rebels have ruled out future cooperation with Tshisekedi, whom Kabila called on to ""return to our camp where we can receive him.""","""1997-04-10T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8NH0-000Y-K1M4-00000-00"""

During much of UNITA's long civil war against the Luanda government after Angolan independence in 1975, Savimbi was backed by the United States, Zaire and apartheid South Africa, while the regime of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos was supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba. cuba. The warring sides finally made peace in 1994 and UNITA joined a national unity government last month. The charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF - Doctors without Borders) has said that 200 civilians, 100 Zairean soldiers and 15 alliance rebels were killed in a battle for Kenge on Wednesday. The town is the last major site on the rebel's road to Kinshasa. Ten Zairean Red Cross workers were reported killed there on Wednesday. Soldiers of Zaire's rag-tag army have consistently pillaged and fled towns before rebels arrive and have rarely put up a fight, but Zairean Prime Minister General Likulia Bolongo has said elite troops have been deployed to defend the capital. The rebels have previously charged that Angolan mercenaries are helping President Mobutu Sese Seko's regime, while Kinshasa accuses Rwanda and Uganda of backing Laurent Kabila's Tutsi-dominated rebel alliance. Angulu alleged that fighting in zones ""liberated"" by the alliance was between Kabila's forces and members of Rwandan Hutu extremist militias and former government troops who fled their own country with hundreds of thousands of refugees in 1994.

South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was due to meet the ailing head of state Saturday in the Gabonese capital Libreville, after flying in there from the rebel stronghold of Lubumbashi. There, he had won agreement from Kabila to meet Mobutu--Zaire's dictatorial ruler for three decades--for the second time on Wednesday, again aboard the South African navy ship Outeniqua. Mobutu, 66, who was in Libreville this week, for a summit of regional heads of state, was expected to return to his war-weary nation later in the day. day. ""We proposed this coming Wednesday, on the South African boat that is moored in Pointe Noire (Congo),"" Mbeki said. ""This matter of that particular date has got to be put to President Mobutu, and we will see how he responds."" A US State Department official said there was a mood of urgency surrounding Wednesday's meeting because of the rebel advance, amid fears of bloodshed in the capital Kinshasa. The first Mobutu-Kabila encounter last Sunday was inconclusive, with both leaders essentially sticking to their positions, but the situation since then has changed in two ways. Firstly, the rebels have taken Kenge, 200 kilometres (125 miles) east of Kinshasa as the crow flies (300 kilometres by road), and pushed government troops back to the Wamba river. Some humanitarian sources reported fighting up to 60 kilometres west of Kenge on the main road to Kinshasa. The rebels also seized Bandundu, 300 kilometres northwest of the capital, maintaining the advance on two fronts. Secondly, Mobutu agreed at Thursday's Libreville summit not to stand again in presidential elections. He had not previously been so explicit. However, the rebels have said they will not accept power being handed to an interim head of state other than Kabila himself. It dampened hopes that the Archbishop of Kisangani, Monsignor Laurent Mosengwo, could resume a former post as president of the transitional parliament, a position which would make him Zaire's interim leader under the constitution if Mobutu resigned. Rebel foreign affairs spokesman Bizima Karaha however rejected the prospect of a parliamentary speaker taking over. ""The transition will be undertaken by the (rebel) Alliance and nobody but the Alliance,"" Karaha said. Once in power, the Alliance would be open to other opposition politicians. US envoy Bill Richardson expressed cautious optimism Friday that a peaceful transition could be achieved, with Kabila at the head of a transitional government. Richardson, who brokered the first Mobutu-Kabila meeting, told US public television: ""I do believe there's still a good chance of a peaceful, inclusive transition government."" He called Kabila ""street smart"" and ""pragmatic,"" but said the president was ""not facing reality"" because his advisors were not telling him the truth about the pitiful state of his forces. Richardson added: ""I believe that Mobutu is now realistic; he's a dignified person; he wants to go out gracefully."" West of Kenge, government troops and rebels were locked in what appeared to be one of the biggest battles of nearly seven months of civil war. Zairean Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba said Friday that the government forces were holding a line on the Wamba river west of Kenge, but Karaha claimed the rebels were 50 kilometres to the west. Hundreds of people are feared to have died in the fighting for Kenge, one of the first times the Zairean army has put up serious resistance against rebels who have seized two thirds of Africa's third largest country. km/rom Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko will leave Gabon's capital Libreville for Kinsasha mid-day Saturday, after accepting to meet again Wednesday with rebel leader Laurent Kabila.

An aide to South African President Nelson Mandela, one of the architects of the peace process, said Mandela still planned to leave Friday to attend the Mobutu-Kabila meeting. But an official in the Zairian Embassy in South Africa said final details about the talks still had to be worked out. The official, Jean-Nestor Bokumbe, said the embassy was told Mobutu had agreed to meet Kabila, but the date and location of the ship remained unresolved. Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, patched together the meeting after reports emerged that Mobutu was backing away from his promise to meet Kabila. Richardson, who had been in Zaire since Monday trying to arrange the talks, said the ship would set sail from Libreville, Gabon, and then head into international waters. The talks will be chaired by the United Nations. He said Kabila had agreed to the talks at a meeting Tuesday in the southern city of Lubumbashi. ''This is a historic occasion that hopefully will lead to peace in Zaire,''  Richardson said Wednesday after securing Mobutu's agreement to meet Kabila. ''The U.S. is proud to have played this catalyst role. But now it must turn to Zairians and Africans and the United Nations to bring about this peaceful transition.''  The United States is pushing for a cease-fire and negotiations leading to a transitional government that would include rebels and opposition parties, Richardson said. Then it would like to see Zaire hold a free, fair election. Richardson, who will attend the start of the talks, left for meetings in Angola on Thursday. Kabila and Mobutu had agreed earlier in the week to meet each other, but there was debate over the venue. The rebels who have captured more than half of Zaire since September say there is only one thing to discuss: Mobutu's departure from power. The rebels will not stop their offensive while waiting for a settlement, said spokesman Bizima Karaha. On Tuesday, the rebels easily captured Kikwit, a city on a major highway 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of the capital, he said. ''The next stop is Kinshasa,''  the spokesman. As the rebels advanced on the capital, concerns rose for the safety of foreigners in the country. In London, the British Foreign Office on Thursday advised Britons in Zaire to leave the country. A Foreign Office press officer said the advice was broadcast on the BBC World Service radio, which is widely heard throughout Africa, and also issued through the British Ambassador in Zaire. Mobutu, 66, has insisted he would never bow to Kabila's demand that he resign, but he is under increasing pressure. He is ill with prostate cancer, Western powers have urged him to give up, and the political opposition within Zaire is gaining momentum with each rebel victory.

HONG KONG, May 6 (AFP) - The views expressed are those of the newspaper alone and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Agence France-Presse. South China Morning Post Rebel with a cause In lands as tortured as Zaire and neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi, it is unlikely that things can get much better, but possible to hope that they may become less bad. There is no stopping the forces of rebel leader Laurent Kabila from routing the army of the beleaguered President Sese Seko Mobutu, regardless of how reluctantly he relinquishes his 32-year grip on power. The sooner Mr Mobutu steps down, the more lives will be spared. He has drained the mineral rich country of its wealth, accumulating a DOL5 billion fortune in the process, and he has subjugated the population, but his iron grip as the self-styled father of his people imposed stability of sorts. sorts. Mr Kabila, the man who will topple him, by negotiation or otherwise, hardly suits the guise of a liberator. He has shown scarcely a vestige of humanity in recent weeks, presenting aid workers with impossible deadlines to evacuate refugees. The suffering of these exhausted, terrified and starving hoards has become so utterly desperate that they have nowhere left to run. Mr Mobutu's proposal to place Zaire in the hands of a transitional government is rejected by Mr Kabila, who is guaranteed victory and does not need to make any deals. But if Mr Mobutu bows to the inevitable, a negotiated and peaceful solution would bring an instant end to the conflict. The two are old adversaries. Mr Kabila is a Marxist who has fought for Zairian independence for 30 years. He now talks grandiosely of changing the face of Africa. If serious, Mr Kabila will have to start by offering some kind of hope and stability to the people of the country. It will take years to restore balance to the divided nation, even if he is capable of such a feat. Although the rebel leader has lived among Tutsi tribes for most of his life, he is not a Tutsi. This is a plus point in a country where rumours persist that there is a plot to create a Tutsiland''  in Central Africa. Zaire is home to 250 ethnic groups and it is debatable that the relatively unknown rebel can unite them, rebuild the infrastructure in a land the size of Western Europe where there are hardly any phone lines, or wipe out the corruption that pervades every level of society. Mr Kabila will take over an impoverished country rich in diamonds, gold, cobalt and copper. Properly governed, Zaire could become one of the most prosperous nations in Africa. Observers are not disposed to believe Mr Kabila is the man to make it that way, but time will tell. If he wishes to build confidence in his ability to rule, he will call for elections and establish democratic institutions once he takes power. The United States and South Africa might be willing to send observers to see fair play, and Zaire could finally be on the brink of a lasting peace. The Australian New quality in our German relations In 1890, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany stunned Europe by sacking the man who had made Germany great, the Iron Chancellor, Count von Bismarck, thus prompting a famous cartoon -Dropping the Pilot'' . Europe of the 1890s reflected Bismarck's will and determination. Certainly, the unification of the German States was the product of his strategic thinking. To an extent, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has, 100 years later, a reputation which rivals Bismarck's for its scope and forcefulness. The unification of the two post-war Germanies and the European Union's Maastricht trade agreement are symbols of Mr Kohl's dominance of Germany and influence in Europe since his election in 1982. But in the run up to German elections next year, in which Dr Kohl has indicated he will stand for a record fifth term, there are a number of significant problems that could well rebound against him. Key among them is an unemployment rate of more than 12 per cent - resulting in more than 4.6 million people out of work. Economic growth of about 2.5 per cent is regarded as unlikely to bring about the Government's promise of creating 2.3 million jobs by the turn of the century. And Mr Kohl's ardent pursuit of European Monetary Union, and the euro currency, puts huge fiscal pressure on Germany if it is to reach the threshold of a 3 per cent budget deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product. Germany's structural reform strategy is to reduce business taxes, improve labour market flexibility, speed up deregulation and privatisation, strengthen research and development and open up global markets. It is in pursuit of the last that Mr Kohl is visiting Australia with a group of leading German businessmen. Germany is Australia's ninth-biggest trading partner, ahead of Indonesia, but the trade link is somewhat traditional: wool, iron ore, copper and gold in a 1996 export total of DOL1070 million, compared with imports from Germany of DOL4701 million, dominated by manufactures. After his meeting yesterday with the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, Dr Kohl said he wanted his visit to inject a new quality into the economic, political and cultural relationship between the two countries. His thesis was that Australian investors should seize the opportunities offered by a reunified Germany and developments within the European Community. Mr Howard responded by noting that while Australia had a strong affinity with the Asia-Pacific region, most direct Australia investment went into Europe. There is absolutely nothing incompatible between our association with the Asia-Pacific and deep and growing economic and other ties with the nations of Europe,''  he said, while acknowledging that Dr Kohl's views on the European Union were strong, robust and direct. Mr Howard knows Australia could do far worse than having Mr Kohl as a friend in the European court. Hong Kong Standard No let-up in the fight against crime groups The fate of 17-year-old actress' daughter Pai Hsiao-yen will have sickened even the most hardened newspaper reader. The discovery of the Taiwanese teenager's mutilated body in a ditch near Taipei has raised public anger in the island at the level of violence in Taiwan society. Students outraged by the murder have demanded the resignation of Premier Lien Chan. And Taiwanese opposition deputies have threatened to impeach President Lee Teng-hui, holding him responsible for social unrest stemming from violent crime in the island. Links between triads and the political scene in Taiwan are well-documented. Police revealed last June that Taiwan had at least 126 organised crime groups, whose 5,800 members had strong influence over elected assemblies and public projects. A National Police Administration report said gangs were increasingly involved in political violence and rigging tenders for public works, as well as activities like drug and gun smuggling, prostitution and gambling. Concern over violent crime has led to repeated crackdowns in Taiwan. Each time, officials have insisted that their hardline stance was paying off. But these claims were not always reflected in crime statistics. Taiwan is not alone. Organised crime has reared its ugly head in other Chinese communities, notably Macau. In many of these places there is clear evidence that politics and organised crime are intertwined. Organised crime has always been attracted by the chance of making money; increasingly, it seems, these gangs are attracted by power. There is no reason why Hong Kong should be spared from some of the uglier manifestations of this trend. The territory is certainly no stranger to organised crime. It is clear that the authorities here must not heed demands to loosen the laws that are important weapons against the growing trend towards violent crime. The Jakarta Post The Busang gold hoax Independent consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd has proven without a doubt that what had been claimed by Canadian Bre-X Minerals Ltd as the richest gold find of the century turns out to be the biggest hoax in the history of mining anywhere in the world. It was even the fraud of the century, due to the evidence of Bre-X's tampering with samples and falsification of assay values. The stunning report on Sunday from Strathcona to Bre-X's president David Walsh virtually spells the end of Bre-X with billions of dollars in losses to its shareholders. Strathcona's conclusions from the assay results from 175 core samples sum up the almost mythic proportion of fraud, by stating ""the magnitude of the tampering with core samples that we believe has occurred and resulting falsification of assay values at Busang is of a scale and over period of time and with a precision that, to our knowledge, is without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world."" The possibility of tampering with samples (salting the samples with foreign gold) had been hinted immediately after Freeport-McMoran Copper et Gold Inc revealed, after preliminary tests in late March, that it found insignificant amounts of gold in the Busang area in East Kalimantan. But analysts still found it hard to believe that a hoax of such proportions could have been kept up for three years without word leaking out. The tampering, as discovered by Strathcona, was indeed mind-boggling, as it involved roughly 100,000 samples from 100 miles worth of core digging. Apart from Bre-X shareholders, the are many other parties who are directly or indirectly burnt by the Busang saga, which was spiked by the suicide of Bre-X geologist Michael de Guzman who plunged to his death from a helicopter into the jungles of Kalimantan on March 19. The Busang debacle tells stories of greed, political pressures and suspected insider trading practices. Scams and spectacular failures use to be part of the landscape of financing mineral explorations but the Busang hoax should be the biggest of all. Greed, we think, played the main part behind the battle for stakes in the Busang property, involving the Indonesian government, Indonesian politically well-connected businesspeople, and two of the world's largest gold mining companies. So blinded had been these aggressive suitors by Bre-X's claim that they had never thought of making due diligence. The Busang fraud did not cause any significant material loss, especially to the Nusamba business group, which is controlled by President Soeharto-chaired foundations, and Freeport. Both were mandated by the government in February to be Bre-X shareholding partners in the joint venture to develop the Busang mine. After all, Nusamba and its Indonesian partners obtained their 30 percent of the Busang property almost for free. But the hoax certainly came as a big embarrassment to them. American J.P. Morgan et Co, which made a great exemption from its business practice of upholding an image of substance and integrity by accepting Bre-X as a client last September, now has to lick the wounds of its image. The Ontario Securities Commission, which approved the Bre-X listing on the Toronto stock exchange, should work harder to improve its credibility. So does Kilborn Engineering, a unit of SNV-Lavalin consulting group which verified the Bre-X Busang find. But the biggest losers, besides Bre-X shareholders, are the hundreds of small foreign prospectors now seeking gold in various areas in Indonesia. The Busang fraud not only would affect foreign investors' confidence in the prospects of Indonesia's great mineral potentials but also would make it much more difficult for small prospectors to raise financing. This in turn may slow down gold exploration in the country. Even though the great lesson has been taught and the mystery around the Busang gold hoax has been unraveled, the story will not end here. Court battles will follow in class-action lawsuits by investors against the Bre-X management and the Busang saga may soon be scripted for Holywood. ends ends","""1997-05-05T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-37D0-0025-F147-00000-00"""
./samples/,"President Laurent Kabila arrived Tuesday in Kinshasa, the capital of the newly named Democratic Republic of Congo, going directly to the residence of the ousted prime minister, and is expected to announce a new government. Kabila flew into the city in darkness from his southern stronghold of Lubumbashi, after apparent security concerns had delayed his arrival earlier in the day. He did not speak to the reporters either at Kinshasa's international airport after he touched down or at the residence of Zairean prime ministers, located in Kinshasa's residential Gombe district, which was sealed off by his alliance troops. Speculation has begun on the possiblity shape that popular opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi will be included in a transitional government. Kabila had promised to make an announcement Tuesday. tuesday. Officials say work will begin meanwhile on drawing up a new constitution. Tuesday, cCrowds turned out on the city centre streets to cheer as Kabila, lionised as the central African country's liberator after more than 30 years of despotic rule by deposed president Mobutu Sese Seko, entered the capital. But it ranked as a relatively discreet arrival for the rebel leader, the groups along the dimly-lit nighttime streets well short of the tens of thousands expected to turn out to greet the new strongman. Meanwhile, late Tuesday, two French businessmen were reported killed at a factory in Kinshasa's outskirts by men in uniform, in the first such killings of foreign nationals since the takeover of the city by Kabila's rebel alliance. A local employee of the US embassy and his driver were also killed, Monday, in a separate incident. The rebel alliance's security chief, Paul Kabongo, speaking late Tuesday, condemned as ""utterly barbaric"" the double murder of the French businessmen. Saying he was ""distraught"" at the killing, he said: ""We must open an inquiry, but I say now it was a provocation by our enemies to discredit the alliance."" Kabongo had indicated earlier that security remained a concern. He said that some parts of Kinshasa remained dangerous, but that the alliance ""will do everything to bring order there, our order and our way of looking at things."" Kabongo, who is likely to be named security minister in the new government, said meanwhile that the alliance was in total control of the vast African country and that even if isolated pockets of resistance were discovered, they would quickly be eradicated. In Washington, the Pentagon said meanwhile, US troops began pulling out of Brazzaville, in the neighbouring state of Congo, Tuesday as the danger to Americans and foreigners in Kinshasa receded. About half of the estimated 300 US troops were flown back to the USS Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship carrying a Marine expeditionary unit, Pentagon spokeswoman Army Lieutenant Colonel Nancy Burt said. With the new regime firmly installed in Kinshasa, in Dubai, visiting Togolese Foreign Minister Koffi Panou on Tuesday confirmed that the man the rebels ousted, Mobutu, was in Lome. ""The president (Gnassingbe Eyadema) received him for humanitarian reasons,"" Panou told AFP from the Qatari capital Doha where he is on a two-day visit. ""We must not forget the humanitarian dimension,"" Panou added. It was the first official Togolese confirmation that Mobutu, who fled his country after Kabila's forces took Kinshasa, was in Lome. More countries meanwhile continued to recognise the new authorities in Kinshasa but in Geneva, several African and European countries asked the UN Tuesday to press the new regime in Kinshasa to authorize a mission investigating alleged human rights abuses in areas of the former Zaire. The country's border with neighbouring Congo remained shut Tuesday, and international air traffic was barred from Kinshasa airport. bur/pcj The killing of two French businessmen in Kinshasa late Tuesday was an ""enemy provocation"" aimed at discrediting the new regime, an official said here.

The businessmen were visiting a site in the Limete district of Kinshasa when two or three men in uniform intercepted them and ordered them into an office, a watchman at the site said. Shots were then heard from the office. The French embassy sent officials who found the men dead from gunshot wounds in the back and legs. One of the men had also been shot in the head.

Asked to whom he was referring, Kabongo said the ""enemies"" could be former Zairean army soldiers. ""There are lots...we have to take steps quickly."" The killing was ""aimed at undermining people's morale and provoking a reaction."" ""We do not hold hard feelings against the French who are a great people,"" Kabongo said. ""We would never attack the French people, never."" The businessmen, well known in Kinshasa, were visiting a site in the Limete district of Kinshasa when two or three men in uniform intercepted them and ordered them into an office, a watchman at the site said. Shots were then heard from the office. The French embassy sent officials who found the men dead from gunshot wounds in the back and legs. One of the men had also been shot in the head. The killings caused alarm among the French community in Kinshasa, both businessmen and diplomats. French citizens living on their own, even in the well-protected central Gombe district, asked to move in with friends. International telephone lines were jammed with calls from anxious relatives in Europe before the names of the two dead were known. Developments in the former Zaire have made many expatriates wonder if they should not leave, a move which would seriously damage the image of the new regime as well as the country's economic potential.

''President Laurent Kabila will assume from now the functions of head of state,''  Kabila said in a statement issued by his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire. The statement was issued at rebel headquarters in Lubumbashi, about 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) southeast of the capital, Kinshasa Rebel leaders made the decision late Friday, he said, to avoid a power vacuum that could lead to conflict and bloodshed. Kabila said he expected 10,000 invading rebel troops to control Kinshasa in ''just a matter of hours.''  The Zairian army was ordered to surrender its arms to the rebels. The rebel leader said he talked by telephone with Mobutu's generals, and ''everyone was ready to receive orders from me, it is clear.''  Kabila said they would read his declaration on the radio in Kinshasa. Kabila said he was not worried about possible resistance from Mobutu's elite presidential guard. ''It is just a small group of robbers, which we are going to crush...very soon,''  he said. Kabila, 56, put on a pair of gold-framed glasses to read the statement in French. He sat a table draped with the yellow-starred flag of the Democratic Republic of Congo, as the rebels call Zaire. Kabila's alliance launched the rebellion in eastern Zaire on Sept. 14, swiftly gaining territory as Mobutu's troops fled _ preferring to loot and run, rather than fight. For Kabila, claiming the presidency was the culmination of a dream that began 30 years ago when he joined the resistance to Mobutu's dictatorship. ''I am happy, very happy to succeed,''  Kabila said with a beaming smile. Kabila said he would form a transitional government within 72 hours and within 60 days would convene an assembly to write a new constitution. He made no mention of elections, which he previously has promised within a year of taking power. Mobutu's cabinet members were advised to continue in their posts and ''await instructions from the alliance.''  Kabila urged calm in Kinshasa, and warned that anyone who harms Zairians or foreigners would be ''severely sanctioned.''","""1997-05-17T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-5KN0-00BT-M37T-00000-00"""

While Zaire's London Embassy expressed satisfaction with the takeover of the country by Kabila's rebels, British Foreign Office minister Tony Lloyd acknowledged the ouster of President Mobutu Sese Seko. ''The end of the Mobutu regime and the advent of a new government in the former Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, brings important new opportunities and possibilities for the people of that country,''  he said. The Foreign Office, pressed on whether this meant Britain officially recognized the Kabila regime, said the United Kingdom only recognized states, not governments. The state has changed its name and Britain has acknowledged that, a spokesman said anonymously. ''We welcome Mr. Kabila's commitment to convene a constituent assembly and to hold elections,''  a statement from Lloyd said. Britain hoped the transitional government would be as broadly based as possible and bring with it ''much needed respect for human rights and the rule of law so long denied to the people of the country,''  Lloyd said. The support of the international community would be essential if those plans were to be realized, he said. ''We look forward to establishing a constructive relationship with the incoming administration,''  Lloyd said.

White House press secretary Mike McCurry delivered the unusually blunt message through reporters as Mobutu fired his prime minister, Etienne Tshisekedi, and named the army chief of staff head of government. Mobutu took the action after soldiers seized longtime rival Tshisekedi, who was trying to move into his new office. Rebels are trying to end Mobutu's 32-year dictatorship. ''We've been pressing for a negotiated solution to the ongoing conflict between the government and the rebel faction for some time,''  McCurry said. ''We welcome reports of some progress on the U.N.-sponsored talks that have been occurring in South Africa.''  ''Meanwhile, we have said that we recognize that a negotiated solution will have to...include agreements on interim transitional government arrangements, leading ultimately to elections. That clearly reflects our view that Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history,''  McCurry said. He said the United States conveyed the message to Mobutu through diplomatic channels ''because the support for President Mobutu is not sufficient to lead Zaire.''  He would not comment on whether the United States was trying to arrange the president's exile but, when asked, said Mobutu should leave the country. ''I think there has to be, as we've just indicated, some arrangements for a transitional process that leads to a newly elected government,''  said McCurry.

A motion of no-confidence to boot him out has been passed (?to that effect) because he had been elected by the transitional government [sentence as heard]. Nominations for prime minister are the responsibility of the political family which is not that of the head of state, namely the opposition.

The radio quoted Gasana as saying, upon his return from a three-day visit to Lusaka, that he had discussed with Zambian officials the case of ""13 culprits, all Rwandan nationals, who committed genocide and massacres in 1994 and who were arrested there."" Gasana, who went to Zambia's capital with Justice Minister Marthe Mukamurenzi, said Rwanda's courts were competent to try them, as the suspects were Rwandans who had committed crimes against fellow Rwandans on Rwandan soil. ""We asked Zambia to discuss with the Rwandan government how these criminals, arrested and jailed by the Zambians, can be extradited, and the Zambian authorities had agreed to consider the request and the procedures to extradite them would continue,"" he said. Friday's broadcast was monitored by the BBC in Nairobi. The Rwandan foreign minister had, during his visit to the Zambian capital, also delivered a special message to Zambian President Frederick Chiluba from Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu. He also held talks with the Zambian justice minister and leading officials of the justice ministry on how to trace and bring to justice people who committed genocide in Rwanda and had since gone underground in Zambia. Most of those sought are Hutu extremists said to have participated in the slaughter of at least 500,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus following the death of Hutu Presidents Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi after their plane was shot down near Kigali on April 6, 1994. An international tribunal, appointed by the UN Security Council to try Rwandan genocide suspects, on January 12 closed its first plenary session, which was devoted to preparing trials of people accused of instigating the 1994 massacres in the central African nation, after asking Brussels to hand over for trial three suspects accused of genocide, two former mayors and an ex-minister. All three, currently detained in Belgium, are accused of organising massacres in southern Rwanda's Butare region in 1994. More than a million Rwandans, mainly Hutus who fled, are still in exile in Zaire and other neighbouring countries, including Tanzania. Many are reluctant to return home for fear of reprisals against the regime installed in Kigali by the victorious Rwandan Patriotic Front. lto/rom AFP The UN Development Programme (UNDP) will provide five million dollars towards rehabilitating 60,000 factional fighters in war-ravaged Liberia, it was announced Friday. The money will be used for vocational training of former combatants and the unemployed, according an agreement signed Thursday between the UNDP and Liberia's transitional government. This should ""enhance (the fighters') smooth integration into society for normal life,"" the agreement stated. Observers said the project will also serve as an incentive for the fighters to give up their weapons to the African peacekeeping force in Liberia, known as ECOMOG. Seeing little chance of employment with an industrial and agricultural infrastructure ruined by the war, most fighters have so far been reluctant to disarm themselves. Under a peace accord ending almost six years of civil war, signed last August, ECOMOG was to begin disarming the fighters mid-January, but a lack of funds and clashes between the peacekeepers and an armed faction have delayed ECOMOG's country-wide deployment, a neccessary precursor to disarmament. The UNDP says it has already provided a little over one million dollars to assess and plan the reconstruction of existing vocational centres in the country. The signing of the assistance package follows a two-day visit to Monrovia last week by UNDP chief James Speth. jkf/afm/rom AFP","""1996-01-26T00:00:00Z""","""3TDD-W8T0-0031-V37H-00000-00"""

Spokesman Nicholas Burns said those who remained ''are going to be in harm's way''  and it was ''common sense''  that they get out. The millions of residents of Kinshasa hunkered down as peace talks designed to avert a bloody battle for control of the capital broke down Wednesday. Albright, interviewed by the PBS-TV ''News Hour''  program, said she hoped the talks could be held on Thursday. ''We are very disappointed the two did not meet,''  she said. ''It is very important for Zaire to have a process toward an elected government.''  And, she said, ''we have to do something about the tragic situation of the refugees.''  Albright said it was essential that Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent Kabila get together ''and we have some sort of peaceful transition.''  With Kabila's forces near the capital and some advance troops already infiltrating Albright said Mobutu ''is looking for ways to have a transition.''  She said she could not ''get into the details.''  South Africa has tried to shepherd peace talks, with the United States playing a major supporting role. Mobutu long enjoyed U.S. support. Succeeding administrations helped keep him in power, often portraying him as a bulwark against communism. But as the country sank into poverty and his vast fortunes increased, the United States distanced itself from Mobutu. U.S. officials are leery of Kabila, however.

./samples/,"By Christophe Parayre MBUJI-MAYI, Zaire, April 8 (AFP) - Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila, whose troops are poised to capture Lubumbashi, said Tuesday that his next target was the capital Kinshasa and ruled out any prospect of a ceasefire until President Mobutu Sese Seko resigned. Addressing tens of thousands of supporters in the diamond centre of Mbuji-Mayi which fell to the rebels without a fight last week, Kabila said: ""We're advancing, we're heading for Kinshasa. That is our objective, the political capital."" Advance troops had already reached provinces of Bandundu and Equateur, east of Kinshasa, he said. said. Kabila told supporters massed in the town stadium that Mobutu was to blame for all the country's woes, and appealed to Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi ""to leave the Mobutu camp."" The rebel leader, who has already pledged to be in Kinshasa by June, said it was in the Zairean capital ""that all the evil done to this country--the killing and the pillaging--was decided. We are going to see these gentlemen on their home patch."" With negotiations between rival delegations in Pretoria adjourning for consultations, Kabila reaffirmed his position that a ceasefire--the main objective of the talks--was out of the question ""until Mobutu signs his resignation."" His ""liberation army"" was now ""more than 40,000 strong,"" with 15,000 men due in Mbuji-Mayi in the next few days with the probable objective of marching on Kinshasa, Kabila said, urging the town's youth to enrol with the rebel force since it was ""an army of the sons of the people."" Kabila said he had turned down an offer by South African mediators on the creation of a transitional Zairean government. South African Vice President Thabo Mbeki, he said, ""phoned me yesterday evening and told me they had reached a critical point (in negotiatons at Pretoria) and were discussing the creation of a transitional government comprising the Mobutists, the (rebel) Alliance and the opposition. ""I answered that the delegates were there to negotiate for the departure of Mobutu, not for seats in government."" He said the talks on a transition government should ""come after his (Mobutu's) surrender of power, and not before."" It would be a ""transition government without the Mobutists....Did you allow the Nazi party, the Italian fascists, to take part in elections after World War II. So why should you expect the Alliance to share power."" He appealed to opposition leader Tshisekedi to ""stop playing the enemy's game."" Addressing the embattled premier, whom he described as ""the devil's premier,"" he said: ""If a leader gets it wrong, it's the activist's job to tell him so, and not to follow him blindly."" Tshisekedi's place, he said, was ""not with Mobutu but against Mobutu."" To the cheers of the crowd he said: ""We are all in the same trench against a single enemy."" The Zairean opposition withdrew its support for Tshisekedi on Saturday after he formed a cabinet without consulting the president or his own parties and said he wanted to dissolve parliament. Kabila's conciliatory tone appeared to be addressed to Tshisekedi's numerous sympathisers in the Mbuji-Mayi region, whom he warned against Mobutu's customary ""divide and rule"" tactics. The hardening of the rebel leader's position towards Mobutu came as negotiations in Pretoria between representatives of Kabila and Mobutu--but not Tshisekedi, who dismissed the talks as ""pointless""--adjourned after four days for consultations. The talks appeared to have stalled on the issue of a ceasefire. Fighting was reported from southern Zaire where despite numerous defections on Monday, government troops defending the second city of Lubumbashi appeared to be offering stiffer resistance than expected to Kabila's advancing forces. cpy/bb/ml AFP afp","""1997-04-08T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-3F00-0025-F518-00000-00"""
./samples/,"The rebel leader who has seized nearly all of Zaire agreed to a cease-fire as a ''gesture of good will''  before meeting with President Mobutu Sese Seko on Sunday. During a somber press conference with a grim Mobutu and smiling rebel leader Laurent Kabila, U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun told reporters aboard a South African naval ship that Kabila had agreed to halt his troops' drive before the meeting. ''As a gesture of good will before the meeting, Kabila has ordered troops to stop advancing on all fronts,''  Sahnoun said. Even as they spoke, rebel troops were said to be advancing closer to the Zairian capital of Kinshasa. And despite Kabila's demand that Mobutu resign after 32 years as leader of one of Africa's poorest countries, there was no mention of the ailing president stepping down. South African President Nelson Mandela emphasized that Kabila had not agreed to a truce. It was not immediately clear if the cease-fire called before the meeting continued after it, or indeed if it had ever begun. ''The question of a cease-fire is not part of his vocabulary,''  he said. ''What he is concerned with is that negotiations will lead to the end of hostilities.''  Mandela, who helped to mediate the talks aboard the SAS Outeniqua, said he would convene another meeting between the two rivals in six to 10 days. Sahnoun said Mobutu proposed the cease-fire and the creation of a transitional government to prepare the Central African nation for its first multiparty elections. Mobutu said he would hand over power to the president elected in that balloting and would not run for office himself, Sahnoun said. But Kabila, according to the communique read by Sahnoun, demands that the rebel alliance take power as the transitional authority and that Mobutu cede power to it. The communique also said the purpose of the next meeting would be to narrow the gap between the two men. Mobutu left the ship without speaking to reporters and was expected to fly back to Kinshasa later in the day. Mobutu has insisted that he will never bow to Kabila's demand to resign, but his prostate cancer and international pressure may yet force him to do so. Mediators believed that the peace talks the first face-to-face showdown between the two rivals could be the last chance to prevent the rebel alliance from forcibly taking the Zairian capital, Kinshasa.","""1997-05-04T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-5FS0-00BT-M3WB-00000-00"""

./samples/,"(White House)--President Clinton is reiterating his support for bipartisan campaign finance reform. Clinton was dogged in the final weeks of his campaign by questionable contributions to the Democratic Party. He says that proves the need for reform. However, Clinton denies his policy toward Indonesia was influenced by contributions with ties to Indonesia's government and banking interests. Much of the focus has centered on Democratic fund-raiser John Huang (wahng) and his ties to an Indonesian banking and investment concern. Clinton defended Huang's appointment to a Commerce Department post, saying he had the needed expertise. The president would not comment on whether there should be an independent counsel to investigate Democratic Party fund-raising. (Capitol Hill)--The election results are still fresh, but the White House and Congress are already preparing to talk. At his news conference today President Clinton said White House and congressional leaders meet next week on two thorny issues--Medicare and a balanced budget. Florida Senator Connie Mack, speaking for Senate Republicans, says the G-O-P looks forward to the meeting. Mack says both sides must swallow hard and find a solution to Medicare's spending problems. (Washington)--A fresh contingent of American troops could be sent to Bosnia next year. President Clinton opened the door to a further deployment as he spoke to reporters at the White House. He cited slow progress in rebuilding the war-shattered country. Clinton said he'd consider sending fresh U-S forces as part of a smaller NATO force if the risks were minimal. He suggested they would have a more limited mission than the current force has had of separating warring ethnic factions. NATO's secretary-general (Javier Solana) is due in Washington next Friday for consultations. And a plan to send American and allied troops for further peacekeeping duties will be discussed. (White House)--The White House has a new chief of staff. President Clinton has tapped North Carolina businessman Erskine Bowles (UR'-skin BOHLZ) to replace Leon Panetta, who's resigning to return to California. The president says Bowles combines brilliant business success with dedicated public service. Clinton also heaped praise on Panetta, saying he had one of the most difficult jobs in Washington. Bowles is a (m) millionaire merchant banker in Charlotte. He first came to Washington in 1993 to head the Small Business Administration and later became deputy White House chief of staff. He left nearly a year ago to spend more time with his family. At a White House news conference, Bowles said he's honored to be chosen.

But Kallstrom says the F-B-I has not spoken to Salinger and has not seen his document. The agent also says it's ""utter nonsense"" that the government has tried to cover up facts about the crash. The F-B-I man still says it's possible a missile downed the plane--but not one fired by the U-S military. Kallstrom's remarks were briefly interrupted today by a man criticizing the investigation. He was escorted out of the news conference. (Pale, Bosnia)--The Serb military commander accused of orchestrating atrocities in the Bosnian civil war has been fired. The Bosnian Serb president announced the dismissal of General Ratko Mladic (RAHT'-koh MLAH'-dich) in a statement on national T-V.

Mladic led the Bosnian Serb army throughout the war and was the most popular figure among the Bosnian Serbs. He was indicted in November 1995 by the United Nations war crimes tribunal for alleged atrocities. He personally commanded several Bosnian Serb offensives, including the onslaught on the eastern Muslim enclave of Srebrenica (SREH'-breh-neet-sah) in July 1995.

Schmitz faces a possible life sentence without parole if convicted of first-degree murder in the slaying of Scott Amadure (A'-meh-door). The judge told jurors they may also consider lesser charges. After they began meeting, jurors asked to see a number of exhibits, including the tape of show in question. They also asked for tapes of 911 calls by Schmitz and by Amedure's roommate. And they sought notes made by the detective who interviewed Schmitz after his arrest. (Santa Monica, California)--A well-known pathologist has told the jury in the O.J.

Simpson has said the cuts on his left hand were from a glass he broke in anguish in Chicago after learning of his ex-wife's death. On cross-examination, Spitz acknowledged no material under the victims' fingernails was linked conclusively to Simpson. As the jurors looked at grisly autopsy photos, Spitz also testified the wounds suffered by Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman indicated their attacker was able to kill them quickly--within 15 seconds for Ms. Simpson, and about a minute in Goldman's case. Spitz said he believes just one killer, and one knife was involved.

They also say there's no evidence to support suspect Timothy McVeigh's allegations that foreign terrorists took part in the bombing.

Prosecutor Sean Connelly acknowledges the government did issue a security alert one month before the April 1995 bombing, warning of threats from foreign terrorists. But he says none of the threats mentioned the Murrah building or agencies in the Midwest. Connelly also rebutted an allegation from McVeigh's lawyer that the bombing may have been a misguided operation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

So says Laura Miller, a Harvard University sociologist and a specialist on gender in the military. Miller says she's surprised by the number of people and length of time involved and the range of charges. In Tailhook, the Navy accused aviators of accosting women at a convention. None of the accused was court-martialed. Four drill instructors and a captain have been charged with violations ranging from rape to sending improper love letters to women trainees. Investigators expect to find more victims and file more charges. The Army says it's strengthening its ""buddy system"" at the Ordnance Center at the Aberdeen Proving Ground to avoid any more incidents. The Army also has ordered a review of all its training facilities worldwide. (Undated)--The international community may intervene in a mushrooming humanitarian crisis in Zaire. Neighboring Rwanda has agreed to support a plan for a military force to guard deliveries of food and water to refugees. More than one (m) million refugees fled to Zaire after a civil war in Rwanda two years ago. They've refused to go home out of fear for their lives. Now, fighting between rebels and government troops in Zaire has uprooted the refugees. And the group Doctors Without Borders estimates 13-thousand have died. Rwanda's president says an outside military force could make sure the refugees get deliveries of aid, and help them return to Rwanda.

But she's proposing to make adultery a felony punishable by up to three years in prison--and then have convicted offenders register with the county clerk. Chicago Democrat Sara Feigenholtz doesn't want people to think she's a prude. She's making the proposal to make a point. Her district includes a well-established gay community, and a spokesman says she was disgusted by recent public reaction against the possibility of legal same-sex marriage. The proposal is Feigenholtz's way of saying if there can be laws against one kind of relationship there can be laws against another. By the way, adultery already is against the law in Illinois.

./samples/,"He captured the country with barely a battle and was greeted by cheering crowds after each new conquest. Now rebel leader Laurent Kabila faces his biggest challenge: trying to balance promises of democracy with the strong leadership needed to rebuild this neglected nation and hold its more than 250 ethnic groups together. Too many wrong moves could quickly turn the millions who urged him on to label Kabila another dictator, and could cost the rebel chief international support needed to fuel foreign investment, revive the economy and help prepare for elections. The career rebel's biggest threats come from his lack of political experience, and from the support he received from the Tutsi-led governments of Uganda and Rwanda to wage his successful campaign against President Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila on Saturday promised to name a transitional government within three days and to introduce a new constitution in 60 days, but he set no date for elections denied for 31 years by Mobutu, and he unilaterally declared himself president. There's a strong argument for Kabila to hold elections as quickly as possible: he's at the peak of popularity for having ousted Mobutu. The longer he waits, the more he risks disenchanting international donors and losing fans among Zaire's nationalistic but ethnically fractious population, which is wary of Kabila's outside support and the ethnic roots of his rebellion. ''We don't know the position of Kabila because of the foreigners behind him,''  said Paul Mdaye, a 26-year-old law student, as he waited for the rebels to march into Kinshasa on Saturday. ''If he tries to work with those Rwandans and Ugandans, he will have big problems,''  Mdaye said. Most of Kabila's original fighters were Banyamulenge, Zairian-born ethnic Tutsis of Rwandan descent who took up arms after Mobutu said they were not true Zairians and tried to expel them. The ethnic makeup of Kabila's army became more diverse as he acquired new territory and recruits, but many Zairians still see it as a Tutsi-led movement that could lead to tribal apartheid in the government and military. Their concerns, and the concerns of the international community, haven't been allayed by the rebels' attitude toward tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees in Zaire. Most of them fled Rwanda in 1994 fearing Tutsi revenge after the Hutu government in power at the time orchestrated the slaughter of about a half-million Tutsis. The United Nations and the now-ousted Mobutu government accused Kabila of trying to avenge the genocide by targeting the Hutus, who had occupied refugee camps along Zaire's eastern borders but were pushed further into Zaire as rebel forces came up behind them. Kabila denies the allegation and accuses the United Nations of incompetence, a sign of his general insouciance toward the international community. Kabila's failure to show up for South African-mediated peace talks in Congo on May 14 a thunderous snub of South African President Nelson Mandela was a striking example of this. So too was Kabila's takeover this month of the national railway, which had been successfully managed by a South African company. The United States' U.N. ambassador, Bill Richardson, acknowledged that Kabila needs some ''seasoning''  in the ways of politics, and the U.S. government admits it's leery of Kabila. ''I cannot tell you that we think he is a democrat,''  State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said recently. Nevertheless, investors are rushing into rebel-held mining regions to strike deals with Kabila, and the world seems content to ignore his lapses for the time being. Mandela even sent a plane to pick up the rebel chief and fly him to South Africa for talks after Kabila reneged on his promise to go to Congo. It's easy to understand, given the fact that compared to Mobutu, just about anyone would look great to Zairians and the West. By driving out the Zairian leader, Kabila managed not only to rid Africa of its premier looter regime but to bring some measure of stability to the entire Central African region. Mobutu was at odds with not just the governments of Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, for his backing of Rwanda's former Hutu leaders, but with Angola's government for his support of rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. His ouster cuts off Savimbi's major supply source, giving the tenuous peace there now a better chance of survival. ''We have on the one side Mr. Kabila, and on the other side Mr. Mobutu, so the balance is quite good in favor of Kabila no matter what,''  said Valentin Mubake Nombi, a member of parliament under Mobutu who grew to support Kabila's armed battle against the dictator. Western diplomats agree, saying that even if the takeover of Kinshasa had erupted in major bloodshed, international criticisms would have quickly passed in favor of encouraging Kabila's political and economic reforms. While acknowledging his problems, they note that he's been concentrating more on fighting a war rather than running a country. Now that he's won, they say, he can begin the task of transforming the rebel movement into a government that will almost certainly come out on top when compared to its predecessor.

./samples/,"A former prime minister traveled to Zaire's second-largest city Sunday to tell residents they were free to embrace the rebels advancing on the provincial capital. Nguza Karl-i-Bond's brief visit to Lubumbashi came a day after he told French radio he was distancing himself from President Mobutu Sese Seko, whom he had served as prime minister in the early 1990s. Karl-i-Bond also said in the radio interview heard in Kinshasa that residents of Lubumbashi and the rest of mineral-rich Shaba province should decide for themselves whether to stay with Mobutu or follow rebel leader Laurent Kabila. The extent of Karl-i-Bond influence was unclear he has been ailing and out of the country recently. But his statements were likely to increase tension in Zaire _ already shaken by the rebellion and wondering whether cancer-stricken Mobutu is physically able to wield the power he has held for nearly 32 years. Zairians are also questioning parliament's inability to name a prime minister just when the country is most in need of leadership. Kabila has captured most of eastern Zaire since beginning his campaign last September. On Friday, his forces claimed to have taken Kasenga, a town on the Zambian border 135 miles northeast of Lubumbashi, and said they were poised to seize Lubumbashi, 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) southeast of Kinshasa. The government has denied that Kasenga had fallen. In most cases, Mobutu's poorly disciplined soldiers have fled from the rebels, often looting the towns they were supposed to protect before retreating. The rebels have been welcomed in other towns by people who accuse Mobutu of neglecting his country while enriching himself. The rebels are continuing their advance as both they and the government prepare for peace talks expected to begin in South Africa in the next few days. Karl-i-Bond told supporters at Lubumbashi's airport Sunday that they should decide for themselves whether to back Mobutu or Kabila, according to a member of his Union of Independent Federalists and Republicans, reached in Kinshasa and speaking only on condition of anonymity. Karl-i-Bond also called for a change in government leadership but did not directly refer to Mobutu, the source said. Karl-i-Bond stopped in Lubumbashi on the way to South Africa, where he has spent most of the last several months being treated for heart problems. The Shaba native was ousted as prime minister in 1992 by a national conference organized to prepare for Zaire's transition from dictatorship to democracy. Soon after he lost his post, he urged Shabans to oppose the transitional government. Shaba twice tried to break away from Zaire in the 1970s.

Kengo was accused of mishandling the war, and last week he resigned.

Richardson will be sent to Zaire to meet with rival factions and to help get relief supplies to desperate Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire, the White House announced Saturday. An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Richardson would leave for Zaire on Monday. Richardson's latest assignment will have him meeting with President Mobutu Sese Seko in Kinshasa and with rebel leader Laurent Kabila, probably in the eastern city of Kisangani. ''He will press both sides to agree to halt the fighting and to launch serious negotiations to form an inclusive transitional government leading to free and full democratic elections,''  White House press secretary Mike McCurry said. ''During the mission, Ambassador Richardson will also underscore the deep concern of the United States regarding the humanitarian situation, refugee repatriation and human right in Zaire,''  McCurry said. Since October, Kabila's forces have seized much of the eastern half of the country. Efforts in recent weeks to arrange a meeting between Kabila and Mobutu have failed. The administration also is concerned about the fate of up to 100,000 Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire. In recent weeks, they have been forced from camps in the region and are now scattered over a wide area with no access to food or other necessities. Richardson was also to travel to Angola in hopes of persuading officials there to stay out of the Zairian conflict, the U.S. official said. The Angolan government is strongly opposed to Mobutu for his years of backing Angola's UNITA rebels for years. A peace agreement has been reached in Angola but some officials believe differences between the factions in Angola over Zaire are hampering reconciliation. As a congressman from New Mexico, Richardson gained renown as a diplomatic trouble-shooter.

Speaking at a round table here organised by the International Peace Academy, former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere said that the new Zairean leader Laurent Kabila ""needs time to consolidate"" before holding elections. ""He must concentrate on building structures before this miracle of multiparty elections in Zaire,"" said Nyerere, who is spearheading regional efforts to find a political solution in strife-torn neighbouring Burundi. burundi. ""I think we should let Kabila provde that country with a decent government and then help the political system develop."" Kabila, who took power on Saturday after his forces marched into Kinshasa, is to unveil his transitional government on Tuesday. Turning to the role of the international community, Nyerere said that ""Zaire has been under the United States and the French for the last 30 years. It's a ruined country. So let's have some humility--leave this country alone."" Referring to talk of a ""war of succession"" in Zaire, in which US influence would succeed that of the French, Nyerere said, ""to us this is an insult. This is 1997--why should it be the French versus the Americans, and the Africans are not allowed to choose their own leaders?"" ""Stop lecturing us, and let us develop,"" he said. Nyerere also criticized plans backed by the UN Security Council for an international conference on the Great Lakes, saying that the initiative ""is coming from the outside."" Nyerere acccused western media of mounting ""a tremendous campaign to demonize Kabila"" in reporting massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire. He said Kabila was a ""victim"" who could not be held responsible for events outside his control. ""Let's wait until Kabila commits his own crimes. He must not be accused for the crimes of others,"" said Nyerere.

./samples/,"Eager to promote democracy in Zaire, the Clinton administration is getting an ambiguous response from rebel leader Laurent Kabila on staging elections in the Central African country after his expected takeover. Kabila has told U.S. diplomats there should be a ""period of stabilization"" before elections, U.S. officials said Thursday. His stance was described as ambiguous. To promote democracy and a free-market economy, the Clinton administration has promised Kabila he could count on $10 million in American help in transforming the government once President Mobutu Sese Seko surrenders power. This would involve direct financial aid, with European governments also expected to contribute a significant amount, said the officials, speaking about U.S. diplomacy in Zaire on condition of anonymity. ""We spoke in terms of significant millions of dollars,"" an official told The Associated Press. ""And Kabila wants to remain in power for some time before holding elections."" Mobutu wants an interim leader installed, the official said, a demand contributing to Kabila's decision to postpone further talks with the Zairian president. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday she was certain Mobutu was looking for a way to yield power to a transitional government. The U.S. hope is that any transitional government, which is expected to include Mobutu and Kabila elements, would move quickly to prepare for elections in Zaire. The resource-rich country has been ruled by Mobutu for 32 years, for most of that time with significant U.S. assistance as a strategic ally of the United States. In recent years, his authoritarian rule and the decline of communism have prompted Washington to keep its distance - and recently to try to encourage him to give way. The question is whether Kabila would advance democracy in Zaire. His forces are on the outskirts of Kinshasa, the capital, and American diplomats are trying to avert bloodshed. Albright told PBS-TV it was essential that Mobutu and Kabila get together and that Mobutu was ""looking for ways to have a transition."" She also said she could not ""get into the details.

./samples/,"LOME, March 26 (AFP) - A summit held here Wednesday on the crisis in Zaire should lead to direct talks between that country's warring parties, Togo's Foreign Minister told AFP. ""Consultations are underway and should lead to negotiations,"" said Koffi Panou shortly before some 15 African heads of state adjourned a summit organised by the Organisation for African Unity. The summit was the first international meeting to bring together delegates from both Kinshasa's transitional government and Laurent-Desire Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire. Kabila's rebels now control more than a quarter of mineral rich Zaire, prompting its strongman of 31 years, President Mobutu Sese Seko, to propose bringing them into a transition government. government. In Lome, the two sides had not had any direct contact with each other by 9:30 p.m. (2130 GMT) Wednesday. But Panou said: ""We do not need to provoke the meeting. It will happen naturally because the two parties attract each other like magnets."" Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema received both delegations at length in the presence of the acting OAU chairman, President Paul Biya of Cameroon, several well-placed sources said. Most sources at the summit believed all concerned were in favour of negotiations and that what had to be settled was rather their venue and date. It was unclear late Wednesday whether the summit, the entire agenda of which was delayed several hours, would continue formally on Thursday. Informal consultations, however, were expected to continue into the night. In Washington, the US State Department said it welcomed a new Zairean negiotating committee to work out power-sharing with rebel forces--but it added that it wants to see results. ""We would like to see the members of the committee designated immediately,"" spokesman John Dinger said. ""We want the parties to enter into immediate negotiations and ceasefire."" Dinger said the US ambassador to Kinshasa had asked for a meeting with President Mobutu Sese Seko as soon as the cancer-stricken president returned to Zaire--but the two have not yet met. Mobutu announced Tuesday a seven-member ""negotiating committee"" made up of representatives of the presidency, the judicial system, the government, parliament and opposition to meet the rebels. In Geneva, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, urged Zaire's rebels to let tens of thousands of refugees return to Rwanda after five months fleeing eastern Zaire's civil war. ""They are malnourished, traumatised and stricken with diseases. They have told us they want to end their agony and return to Rwanda,"" Ogata said in a statement in Geneva. She asked the rebels to promise free passage in the hope the refugees will make the 400-kilometre (380 miles) journey back to their homeland. The first lorry carrying emergency food supplies reached the makeshift northeastern Zairean camp of Lula on Wednesday, where some 18,000 Rwandan refugees are holed up. Rebel authorities in control of the region have refused to allow refugees hoping to make their way back to Rwanda to pass through Kisangani, just seven kilometres (four miles) away. Instead, they want the refugees to return via where they came from--the town of Ubundu, 140 kilometres (87 miles) to the south, from where they have trekked for 10 days. The Rwandan Hutus set up camp at Lula after they were chased out of Ubundu by local people. The lorry which arrived Wednesday was carrying biscuits and milk, as well as medical supplies. burs/rom AFP Representatives of the Zairean government and Laurent-Desire Kabila's rebels met for the first time Wednesday in the Togolese capital Lome, sources in the Togolese presidency said.

./samples/,"Zairean politicians showed no sign on Monday of meeting an ultimatum from President Mobutu Sese Seko to set up a government of national unity to deal with ethnic strife and political chaos. Marshal Mobutu, who returned to Zaire after four months in Europe, immediately asked his supporters and the opposition to present potential members of a ""crisis government"" by midday on Saturday. They failed to do so and Mobutu, who has presided over Zaire's economic and political decline for more than three decades, extended the deadline to Monday, warning through his spokesman that he would otherwise ""assume all his responsibilities."" Political parties and the press have for four days given themselves over to all manner of speculation about who might be called to take office, and about the possible sacking of current Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo. Meanwhile on Monday, a mainly Tutsi rebel alliance which has seized several key towns and a large swathe of eastern Zaire since October said that government troops on Saturday launched a counter-offensive in the Bunia region on the Ugandan border. Several groups in the presidential movement here as well as among the radical opposition have stated that Mobutu will himself appoint a new prime minister, but they thus appear to ignore the provisions of the basic law governing the stop-start transition to democracy, which says that that only the transitional parliament can sack an incumbent premier. The prime minister's successor should also be proposed, according to the constitutional act, by a political grouping ""other than that of the head of state,"" which means the greatly fragmented opposition. Mobutu's opponents include former premier Etienne Tshisekedi, who supporters still consider the legitimate leader, although Kengo benefits from western backing as a man thought likely to be able to restore a semblance of order to the economy. Former Tshisekedi aide Kibassa Maliba, a reformer, is another possibility. Amid such confusion, the replacement of the prime minister seemed unlikely on Monday, but Mobutu has called for a government capable of putting down the rebels, whom Kinshasa says are backed by neighbouring Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. All these countries deny helping the insurgents. Mobutu had an operation for prostate cancer in Switzerland last August and was convalescing there and in France until last week, when he returned to a stage-managed mass welcome at Kinshasa airport and gave an address to the nation. Any new government is also due to organise a consitutional referendum to bring in a democratic Third Republic--after more than six years of bickering among politicians amid economic chaos affecting much of the sprawling country's population. General and presidential elections are scheduled to be held before July 1997. Political and diplomatic observers in Kinshasa believe that any move that plunges Zaire deeper into an institutional crisis will postpone any settlement of pressing business or a democratic transition. Mobutu on Wednesday appointed a new military chief of staff, General Mahele Lioko Bokungu, in what analysts saw as a sign that the disorganised and unruly armed forces could muster a counter-offensive from Kisangani, a major town west of the rebel-held territory. Government troops, who in many cases have received no pay for four years, put up little more than token resistance to initial rebel advances. Soldiers have plundered many of the areas they have passed in their retreat, and some are reported to have sold their weapons to the rebels. mf/nb/job AFP","""1996-12-23T00:00:00Z""","""3TDD-TFX0-0031-V38J-00000-00"""
./samples/,"[2] Text of report by Zairean radio on 23rd November The weekly cabinet meeting took place yesterday under the chairmanship of Leon Kengo wa Dondo, prime minister and head of government. Two items were on the agenda. We will read you a complete report on this meeting. First of all, there was the situation in the east of the country, and secondly, the examination of three draft ministerial bills on the application of the law on press freedom. First of all, it is important to emphasize that the situation in the east of the country occupied the major part of the discussions. On this issue, the cabinet again reiterated its determination to reconquer the part of the territory that is in the hands of the enemy, and calls on the people to have confidence in their army and [words indistinct]. Still concerning the situation in the east of the country, the government examined the statement made recently by Mr Etienne Tshisekedi following his meeting with the head of state in France. It is worth recalling that in its 21st November communique the government informed the public opinion that information in its possession has demonstrated the implication of some Zairean and foreign nationals in events taking place in Nord- and Sud-Kivu. In fact, these elements of information establish that Zaire's aggressors have enjoyed the active complicity of some fellow countrymen during the attacks made against the authorities along the Rhodesia Plains, Bukavu and Uvira in Sud-Kivu, and the localities of Burnagana, Ilumba [phonetic], (?Sangunga) and Goma in Nord-Kivu. Furthermore, the government made it known that as a reward for their complicity, the aggressors confided to some of these fellow countrymen the control of some Zairean towns and localities that fell to them. Today, the only flags flying in the above-named localities that have fallen to them, in particular Goma, Kanyaboyango [phonetic] and Uvira, are those of a certain political party. It is the flag of the UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress] party of Mr Etienne Tshisekedi. The UDPS leader, who was the first to make a statement recognizing the Kigali government's seizure of power by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], has just made (?disturbing) statements which have shed light on the people [words indistinct] benefit by the elements of the complicity enjoyed by the Rwandan Patriotic Army [APR] elements in their aggression against our country. In fact, even though today the entire world [words indistinct] the United Nations, the OAU, the EU and even the countries which support Rwanda, admit that Rwandan and Burundian armies which are supported by Uganda attacked the Republic of Zaire, and that there were hundreds if not thousands of innocent civilians dead - as well men of the [Zairean] Armed Forces - as a result of this aggression, the UDPS chairman had the courage to say that there was no aggression against Zaire, but that it was just an internal affair involving [words indistinct] and some sons of the country with whom one must compose. This statement by the leader, which smacks of treason and complicity with the enemy, has forced the government to file a case against the leaders of the UDPS at the civilian and military courts to establish the complicity of Etienne Tshisekedi's UDPS in the aggression carried out by Rwanda against Zaire, in order [words indistinct] and to appropriately punish all attempts to topple a law-abiding state and those guilty of disturbing the internal security of the state or to [words indistinct]. The government deplores the fact that while the country is at war, some of its own sons [words indistinct] can seize this opportunity to support the enemy with the sole aim of repositioning themselves politically. The government recalls that in conformity with Article 37 of the Transitional Constitution Act, every Zairean has the sacred right and duty to defend the nation and its territorial integrity and to prevent any individual or group of individuals from taking power by force. As we wait for ruling on the courts'course of action, the government leaves it to the people to judge the quality and the behaviour of this person who, after setting the fire, wants to serve as a fireman because of political gains, without considering the sufferings of the people of Zaire seriously affected by war and its effects. Also, the government reminds the national and international opinions that the decision by the Supreme Court dated 21st August 1996 has put an end to the discussions on the legality of the election of Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo by the High Council of the Republic - Transitional Parliament, thus making the present transitional government the only legal government of the Republic of Zaire. The democratic law-abiding state which our people want to establish, in conformity with the wishes of the National Conference, demands that everyone at every level, be subjected to the law and the verdicts of tribunals and courts. It is curious to note that it is the very people who are aspiring to the highest post of responsibility of the state who are showing flagrantly their disrespect for the law, the legal bodies and public order. Touching on the second topic on its agenda, the cabinet examined three draft bills presented by the minister of information and telecommunications. The first two bills addressed the application of Law No 96002 of 22nd June 1996, establishing the mode for the functioning of press freedom for newspapers, periodicals, on one hand, and audio-visual media enterprises on the other. The third draft bill deals with the fixing of administrative fares for the establishment of [words indistinct] prior possession [as received] of permits for the exploitation of radio and television stations, the exploitation of press agencies, the acquisition of permits for advertising agencies, and the authorization for photographic reportage. The session approved these three draft bills. Before declaring the meeting closed, the prime minister informed the ministers of the visit that the Belgian secretary of state for cooperation carried out from 25th November to 2nd December. This visit follows the recent visit paid by the head of government to Belgium in August.

./samples/,"Rebel leader Laurent Kabila declared himself in control of all Zaire today, and his forces entered the capital in triumph. Kinshasa's people lined the streets to welcome the rebels and the end of Mobutu Sese Seko's three-decade dictatorship. By midday, rebels had taken over the Voice of Zaire radio station near Kinshasa's center. Rebel soldiers armed with mounted machine guns stood guard outside the radio station, where hundreds of residents gathered, wearing white headbands to show their support for the rebels. Civilians ran jubilantly through the streets, waving palm fronds and flashing victory signs with their fingers. ""Mobutu has gone crazy! We want Kabila!"" they cried. Mobutu abandoned Kinshasa on Friday and passed control of the country to his Cabinet. Aides said the cancer-stricken president was flying to his northern hometown of Gbadolite, 700 miles away, for a few days' ""rest."" His exact whereabouts and plans were unclear. Mobutu's handpicked prime minister, Gen. Likulia Bolongo, vowed to remain in power ""until the end,"" but urged government troops to remain in their camps - and then slipped out of the country himself. The rebels ordered government troops to surrender their arms by midday. Kabila said he expected his 10,000 fighters to take full control of the capital in ""a matter of hours."" The rebel fighters have faced little opposition from Mobutu's ill-equipped and poorly trained solders during their eight-month advance across the country, and there were no signs of resistance today. Zairian soldiers were retreating from downtown Kinshasa ahead of the rebel advance, one of the military sources said on condition of anonymity. Rebels were well past the international airport and therefore apparently in control of the airfield itself, the source said. About 1,500 rebels were reported to be at a second, cargo airport near central Kinshasa. People lined the road to the airport to welcome the rebel advance. ""Don't call them rebels, call them liberators!"" one Kinshasan cried. Miguel Kamputu, 18, rolled on his back on a filthy sidewalk, shouting, ""Oh, Kabila! Oh, Kabila!"" then shaking with laughter. ""Too much suffering. Too much suffering. He is finally here,"" he said. Civilians carrying automatic weapons monitored Mobutu's soldiers to ensure they did not loot or attack foreigners, as troops have done in other cities. ""We want to keep this area safe to guard the businesses and protect foreigners, stop looting so everything is normal,"" one AK-47-toting resident, John Makwala, told The Associated Press. An estimated 300 Americans were in Kinshasa and U.S. troops were ready to begin an evacuation if they are ordered to do so, Navy Cmdr. Bob Anderson said. About 100 Marines and six aircraft are stationed in Brazzaville, Congo, across the Zaire River from Kinshasa. ""We've pulled a little bit of our force forward,"" he said. As the rebel advance became apparent, confusion erupted in the capital, with some troops fleeing and civilians picking up and firing abandoned weapons. One civilian strode down the street, cigarette dangling from his lip and a grenade launcher swinging on his hip. A crowd walking toward central Kinshasa waved white handkerchiefs as they encountered about 25 Zairian troops. The soldiers fired into the air, then left. Two people were killed, but it was unclear how they died. Kabila, speaking from the southeastern city of Lubumbashi, appealed for calm and said he would form a transitional government by Tuesday and a new constitution within 60 days. The rebel leader said he was taking over in Zaire to avoid a power vacuum and more bloodshed. Kabila said he ""will assume from now the functions of head of state."" Kabila said today he had spoken to Zairian army generals in Kinshasa and they were ""ready to receive orders from me."" ""I am happy, very happy to succeed,"" Kabila said with a beaming smile. Witnesses said the head of the presidential guard, Gen. Nzimbi Ngbale, fled by boat to Brazzaville just hours after Mobutu's departure. The presidential guard, which numbers about 3,000, was the main enforcement tool during Mobutu's iron-fisted rule, and it had been seen as the only united force likely to fight in his defense. The tens of thousands of regular soldiers have either fled or joined the rebels. Western military sources said army chief Gen. Marc Mahele Lieko Bokungu - one of the top generals who had advised Mobutu on Thursday that troops would not defend the capital and that he should leave - was killed about midnight Friday by a Zairian soldier. One of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said today the general was shot as a traitor. Prime Minister Likulia said in a radio broadcast today that he would continue his mission ""to the end."" But within an hour, a Western diplomat said that the premier - a four-star general who rarely made appearances without his full dress uniform - had slipped across the river to Brazzaville. The 66-year-old Mobutu, who has prostate cancer, was expected to seek exile in Morocco, diplomatic sources said. On Friday, his information minister read a statement saying that Mobutu retained the title of president but relinquished all power over the handling of state affairs to his government. Mobutu's apparent abdication followed months of cajoling by his former allies, including the United States, which had seen his departure as the best way to ensure a transition of power without further bloodshed. Kabila has promised to undo the damage wrought by Mobutu's nearly 32 years in power - to restore order and integrity and hold democratic elections. But he has been short on specifics, and his troops have been accused of atrocities against refugees. In a victory speech, Kabila said Mobutu no longer concerned him. ""He can stay in his village, but I think it is not very important at all,"" Kabila said. Mobutu's Cabinet members were advised to continue in their posts and ""await instructions from the alliance."" Kabila urged calm in Kinshasa, and warned that anyone who harms Zairians or foreigners would be ""severely sanctioned."" Rebel leaders demanded the government's unconditional surrender. ""We ask our population in all the country - specifically in Kinshasa - to stay in their houses, to be calm and not to do anything to jeopardize the situation in Kinshasa,"" rebel Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha said. There were rumors that Mobutu's son, Capt. Mobutu Kongulu, had fled to Brazzaville.

The source, who closely monitors the civil war in Zaire, said the soldiers were mainly those who fled from Gemena and Businga as rebels approached. He said looting began Monday. The source said even some members of Mobutu's elite presidential guard drawn from his Ngbandi tribe and related ethnic groups from his Equateur region joined in the looting - usually an indicator in that a place is about to fall. ""They have gone on rampage in Gbadolite. They started looting on Monday and we understand the place is now thoroughly looted,''  said the source. The rebels are closing in on Zaire's capital Kinshasa and Gbadolite, an army outpost well-equipped with military hardware. The rebels said their forces will be in Kinshasa in the next day or two. U.S. envoy Bill Richardson urged Zaire's rebel leader not to take Kinshasa by force and suggested the creation of a transitional government. Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, made his case Monday during meetings with rebel leader Laurent Kabila and his loyal chiefs who have backed the seven-month offensive against Mobutu. Kabila has given Mobutu eight days to resign or be chased from Kinshasa.

The youth movement of the Democratic Union for Social Progress said it would go ahead with a march Wednesday in Kinshasa despite the new government's ban on all political party activity. ""They claim to be liberators, but it is as if they have taken us from one prison cell to another prison cell,"" Raymond Kahungu Mbemba, the youth movement's national secretary, told reporters. ""We cannot accept that."" The ruling Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo has banned public meetings and protests and warned that violators would be considered ""enemies of the liberation of the Congolese people and will be punished to the fullest extent of the law."" Alliance soldiers broke up a student protest Saturday, hauling the demonstrators away in trucks and confiscating film from photographers covering the event. The Alliance also has called on people to surrender any unregistered weapons and has sought to avert protest strikes by threatening absent workers with punishment. Kabila has angered the Democratic Union by failing to include its leader, Etienne Tshisekedi, in the transitional government. The edicts have undermined confidence in Kabila's promises to liberate the country from 32 years of dictatorship under Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila banned political parties outright in some other parts of Congo during his seven-month sweep across the country, which culminated in his declaring himself president on May 17. South African President Nelson Mandela, who unsuccessfully tried to arrange a peace settlement between Kabila and Mobutu, said today that the new government's political restrictions were understandable. ""I think that dealing with a country which has been under dictatorship for more than three decades, it is quite reasonable for him to ensure that law and order is stabilized before he can say 'I want all political parties to function,' "" Mandela said in Cape Town, South Africa. ""He has made it clear that he's committed to democracy and that in due course he will allow the operation of parties,"" Mandela said. ""I think...we can trust him on the basis of his record to keep his word."" Kahungu, however, accused Kabila and his army of using the same oppressive tactics of Mobutu. All Congolese should ""mobilize with their last energy to get rid of these invaders of the (Alliance) and of the neo-Mobutuist Mr. Kabila who are trying to reduce us to slavery,"" Kahunga said. Opposition groups will use nonviolent pressure to weaken Kabila, just as they did Mobutu, he said. The group also demanded that foreign troops who helped Kabila liberate the former Zaire to return home. ""The movement calls on foreign countries, especially the United States, South Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, Angola, countries which are supporting the (Alliance) to understand that only Congolese must decide the future their country,"" Kahunga said.","""1997-05-27T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8330-000Y-K489-00000-00"""
./samples/,"[16] President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has called on the people of Angola for joint efforts to overcome Angola's current ""crisis"" . In a recorded address to the nation broadcast on the eve of the 20th anniversary of Angola's independence (11th November) he stressed what he called the heroic deeds which had led to Angola's independence but said that the development of the national liberation struggle contained some of the seeds of current problems. He said that Portuguese colonial rule had only benefited a minority of Angolans but independence had come at a difficult time and problems had continued thereafter, with pressure from abroad and invasions from South Africa followed by the civil war, which had caused 300,000 deaths. Following the signing of peace agreements it was necessary to consolidate peace rapidly, he said, adding that steps were being taken to improve the economy. Finally, he called for united efforts to increase national production and thereby consolidate independence. The following is the text of his speech, with subheadings added editorially, which was broadcast by Angolan TV on 10th November People of Angola: We have been independent for the last 20 years. During this period, many Angolans were born free of the colonial yoke that Angola had borne for about 500 years. The development of the struggle for national liberation contained some of the reasons for current problems We still need to write adequately the history of our national liberation. In the genesis and development of this process, we shall certainly find some of the reasons to explain most of the problems we are facing today, because the total and complete independence we seek has its price. It is a difficult but honourable path, on which thousands of anonymous Angolans have trod. They include Angolan guerrillas, clandestine fighters, as well as political prisoners and political leaders, including Agostinho Neto Angola's first president, whose role and heroic deeds are points of reference in our history. Those deeds cannot be forgotten without misrepresenting our history. Colonial rule benefited only a minority of Angolans Today, because of the many difficulties we are experiencing, there is a strong tendency, in certain circles of our society, to glamorize the colonial regime and hail its economic achievements. These people forget, however, that those achievements did not benefit the overwhelming majority of the Angolan people. The country became independent with a minute number of cadres who had university education or management experience. There was no single Angolan industrialist. All existing property belonged to Portuguese citizens. In the judicial sector, there were only three university graduates. In the public service the situation was no better. It is enough to recall that throughout colonial history there were only two Angolan provincial secretaries. This situation was made worse by a massive exodus of Portuguese citizens who had been responsible for the normal operation of state institutions and the Angolan economy. Independence came at a difficult time and problems continued What is more, Angolan independence was proclaimed during a period of total war, with two foreign armies - from South Africa and Zaire - on the doorstep of the country's capital. As aggression was repulsed and the central government's authority was beginning to be consolidated throughout the land, a coup attempt led to the death of many leaders, cadres and people, and created an atmosphere of confrontation and distrust throughout the country, with disastrous and traumatic consequences for the reunification of the Angolan people. Two years after the death of the first president of Angola, a vacuum was created. This vacuum had begun to be filled gradually when, in the early 1980s, we experienced new South African invasions and a temporary occupation of a vast region in the southwest of Angola. As a matter of fact, the invasions led to the biggest conventional battles ever waged in Sub-Saharan Africa, with tragic results for our country's people and infrastructure. More than 200,000 people were displaced, about 30,000 people were killed and material damage amounted to 12bn dollars. Even today, the town of Ndjiva, the capital of Cunene Province, is in ruins. We experienced the implementation of the apartheid regime's strategy of total war against southern African countries. We countered this strategy with our programme of defence for the achievement of peace. The fundamental contribution of the Angolan people and government has almost been forgotten today. As a result of this contribution, it was possible to resolve one of the most serious conflicts threatening world peace and preventing the development of a region with an exceptional economic potential. Without this contribution, it would not have been possible to conclude and sign the New York Accords in December 1988 between Angola, Cuba and South Africa. The signing of these accords was a decisive step towards resolving the regional conflict and igniting our efforts to achieve internal peace, to end foreign interference and to consolidate national independence. This process was followed by the signing of the Bicesse Accords and the subsequent democratic multiparty elections on 29th and 30th September 1992. When the cycle of violence seemed to have come to an end and the process of national reconciliation had begun, the war resumed - the biggest tragedy in Angola's recent history. the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola UNITA decided to contest the election results by force of arms, regarded as free and fair by the United Nations and all international observers present. The figures speak for themselves. The continuation of the internal conflict in only two years reached unthinkable figures, exceeding all previous conflicts: More than 300,000 people were killed. About one million were wounded. Five provincial capitals and dozens of villages were reduced to ruins or completely paralysed economically and socially. Important agricultural areas became totally unproductive. Three million people were forced to abandon their home areas. All the infrastructure - including bridges, roads, schools, hospitals and factories - which had been rehabilitated during the pre-electoral period, was totally destroyed. New peace and national reconciliation efforts were undertaken to end the fratricidal war. About a year ago we signed the Lusaka Protocol, which was hailed throughout the world. I shall return to this topic later. Prospects and gratitude for sacrifices made Twenty years after the end of the colonial war, and because of our people's determination and sacrifice, Angola continues to maintain the integrity of its borders. It has affirmed and consolidated its sovereignty, and it is already occupying a respectable place among the nations of the world. Without trying in any way to give a falsely optimistic view of reality - which we recognize as being serious and full of problems - it is only fair to stress that the Angolan people are today more aware of their national identity and the factors that unite them as a people different from other peoples in the region, on the continent and throughout the world. This achievement has been made possible, first of all, because of the integration, without distinction, of people of all ethnic groups, races, origins and social class, in our army police, and other forces of law and order. It was in these bodies - true bastions - that the love for the fatherland was forged and the values and principles that enshrine and justify it were defended. The sacrifices of the defence and security forces, in close alliance with the people, can never be sufficiently recognized. We bow our heads to all those who fought so that Angola could survive as a free, democratic and independent nation. We pay homage to all those who fell so that Angola could survive as a free, democratic and independent nation. Feeling of belonging to one nation has gained strength At various other levels - from sports to culture and education - this feeling that we belong to one nation has gained strength. We see today that we proudly react as one nation when one of our writers, musicians, painters or sportsmen gains international fame. We also react as one nation when we try to defend our understanding of the history of the fatherland and our cultural roots. What is more, the introduction of political pluralism during the 1990s has made it possible for all Angolan citizens to join political parties of their choice, broadened the possibilities for all people to take part in public life and allowed them to identify clearly as members of the same fatherland, although with different views and proposals for resolving their many common problems. This plurality of views and this unity in difference encourage us to say that even our country's most complex problems can be tackled and resolved, as long as there is a patriotic desire by all Angolans to help overcome them, while rigorously respecting the rule of law. Other positive signs of our society's vitality can be clearly seen in the growing movement of associations and in the willingness of some associations and nongovernmental organizations to carry out projects of social solidarity with the children and citizens who are facing hardship. It is equally fair to stress the role played by churches in their efforts to mobilize believers for pacification and national reconciliation, as well to validate the values of the family, life and human dignity. Gratitude to community leaders Now a word to the old ones - notably to the leaders of our communities and the traditional authorities who played a big role in maintaining social cohesion during periods of acute crisis and war, particularly when and where the state administration was missing. Sometimes misunderstood, these leaders became targets when all they wanted was to protect their communities and property. The entire nation must pay sincere homage to all those traditional leaders, religious leaders and representatives of humanitarian organizations who died in the service of the people. ""We now need to consolidate peace rapidly"" We now need to consolidate peace rapidly, which is indispensable to normal life. This is what I am seeking in my talks with the president of UNITA. In Brussels, we noted that the situation was tense in some regions of the country and that we had to take specific steps to reinforce mutual trust. We agreed to work to create conditions in four assembly regions in Huambo and Uige. We agreed to work for the confinement of UNITA troops and their incorporation into the Angolan Armed Forces FAA, as scheduled, in those regions. What is more, it was agreed that the FAA and the Rapid Intervention Police units in those regions would carry out their tasks, as stipulated in the Lusaka Protocol. It was established that 20th November or 25th December would be the probable deadlines for concluding those tasks. Following the confinement and incorporation, the extension of the state administration will immediately begin in those regions, with the appointment of district administrators and provincial governors, including cadres selected by UNITA, in conformity with the annexes to the Lusaka Protocol, thus beginning with the task of national (?reconciliation). Mr Alioune Blondin Beye, the special representative of the UN secretary-general in Angola, and the peace process observers, have hailed and supported this initiative and decided to encourage it. The implementation of the Lusaka Protocol is currently at a crucial stage, which will demand political courage, reflection and, above all, very close cooperation among all the parties involved. The Angolan people have in their hands the key to the solution. I believe this time they will place national interests above all other interests, so that these actions can be come to a successful conclusion and make the peace process irreversible. Practical measures to improve the economy What is more, we need to redouble efforts to halt the deteriorating economic and social situation, which is characterized by an almost inoperative productive apparatus, an increasingly serious social crisis, reduced purchasing power, shrinking real salaries, increased unemployment and the near-destruction of the public administration. Contrary to predictions made in bad faith by certain circles, the practical measures adopted last September have been implemented, while the permanent tasks are also being carried out. The benefits of these measures will begin to be felt by the Angolan people this month . Henceforth, we shall have two periods defined by the Council of Ministers. The first period involves practical actions for the months of November and December, with combined general measures affecting fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies, as well as prices and revenues. These macroeconomic measures must create a situation that favours economic growth and the production of increasing wealth, without ignoring social and political issues. The second period will be to readjust the programme for 1996. There will be no major changes. We shall only be following a new strategy in the programme's implementation. Appeal for unity ""to overcome the current crisis"" We must always hope that we shall all, together, be able to overcome the current crisis. We must believe in our own strength. We must motivate our workers, as well as support and help to build a dynamic national business sector that will be able to increase national production and contribute towards economic growth and the consolidation of national independence. Let this day be a day of reflection and faith in the future of our great country! The challenges faced in the past have never made us give up. Now that we are nearer to realizing our aspirations we shall not give up. Angola will finally have to be a viable and precious country for all its people. United, the Angolan people will win! United, the Angolan people will win! Repeats Long live Angola!","""1995-11-20T00:00:00Z""","""3S51-MH50-0017-G4S5-00000-00"""
./samples/,"The search for a solution to Zaire's refugee crisis continued Sunday, as rebel leader Laurent Kabila was in Kisangani to meet with U.N. and other officials over accusations that his soldiers had maltreated the refugees. Kabila has denied that his forces were carrying out a policy of ""slow extermination"" of over 80,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees in rebel- held territory, as alleged Friday by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. Kabila is under pressure to explain what has happened to the refugees, who fled their camps south of Kisangani and are missing in the bush, after reports that they were repeatedly attacked by rebels and Zairean villagers last week. The rebel leader held an initial round of talks Saturday with visiting European Union envoy Aldo Ajello, about the plight of the refugees. Kabila travelled to Kisangani personally to sort out the crisis, which is the most serious to dog him yet in his seven-month- old rebellion, and has brought fierce criticism from the international community. Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is being sent to Zaire to press for a ceasefire, and to encourage peace talks between Kabila and Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko. The U.S. hopes such negotiations could lead to an ""inclusive transitional government leading to free and fair democratic elections,"" the White House said Saturday. The leaders of Zaire's main religious groups have also called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the civil war, according to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio Sunday. There is growing pressure on Kabila and Mobutu to sort out their differences, before rebels reach the capital Kinshasa. Mobutu has said he is ready to travel to Gabon's capital Libreville ""at any time"" to meet Kabila for face-to-face talks, but Gabon's President Omar Bongo says he's still waiting for a response from Kabila. Earlier attempts to get Zaire's president and rebel leader together in South Africa failed, though South African President Nelson Mandela is expected to chair the peace talks in Gabon if they get off the ground, Gabon's office of the president said. It is feared that a rebel assault on Kinshasa could provoke a wave of desperate looting and killing by Zairean soldiers who may feel cornered, as they have done in other towns that fell to the rebels. Zaire's government has sent reinforcements to the town of Kikwit, some 300 kilometers east of Kinshasa, and the last major town along the main road to the capital. Rebels say they have targetted Kikwit for attack, and if it falls, they could reach Kinshasa within a matter of days. dpa slg","""1997-04-27T00:00:00Z""","""3RPR-R7H0-0094-N0P7-00000-00"""

Mobutu Sese Seko, 66, set himself up as head of state in November 1965 after removing the country's first president Joseph Kasavubu a year earlier. earlier. Considered one of the world's richest men, Mobutu has been severely criticised for breaches of human rights. Under pressure from abroad and at home, he announced in 1990 that a multi-party system would be introduced after a transitional period. The first multi-party presidential and general elections are scheduled for 1997. Mobutu underwent surgery for prostate cancer last August in Switzerland and spent time in France recovering before returning home in late March. Laurent Kabila, 56, self-designated coordinator of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo, is a former activist of the great communist rebellion that unsettled Zaire in 1964-1965. A warlord and an alleged gold black marketeer, Kabila never compromised with Mobutu, unlike others who accepted offers of senior posts in the administration. Etienne Tshisekedi, 64, leader of the Zairean opposition, was appointed minister many times before he broke with Mobutu in the 1980s and founded the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, then an illegal party. On November 21, 1996, after meeting the convalescent President Mobutu in France, he declared himself prime minister of a ""national unity government"". He was appointed to succeed premier Kengo Wa Dondo on April 2, but was forced to stand down on April 9. bur/gd/pcj pcj","""1997-05-04T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-37S0-0025-F1Y5-00000-00"""

Western dipolomats, meanwhile, pushed for a peace settlement between Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent Kabila, with some expressing doubts that the ailing Zairian dictator would ever return to Zaire as he has promised. ""The next few days are critical for peace in Zaire,"" U.S. envoy Bill Richardson said in Paris. He briefed French diplomats after his nine-day shuttle diplomacy, which included several meetings with Kabila and Mobutu, Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, refused to say whether Mobutu would go into exile, though he all but acknowledged the dictator's nearly 32-year reign was coming to an end. ""The ultimate solution will involve a transitional government - there's going to be a change in Zaire,"" Richardson said. In a statement, the leaders of five regional Zairian allies called on the Zairian Armed Forces to prepare for elections and said Mobutu was too ill to contest the vote. Mobutu signed the statement, along with the presidents of Gabon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Chad and the foreign minister of Cameroon. The document, read aloud at a news conference, made no mention of Mobutu resigning or giving power to a transitional authority that would include Kabila, as the rebel chief has demanded. When Mobutu was asked if he intended to return to Kinshasa this weekend, he replied angrily, ""Why not?"" Zaire's information minister, Kin-Kiey Mulumba, dismissed speculation that Mobutu had used the sudden trip to Gabon to go into exile. He threatened to expel foreign media who had suggested as much. South African government spokesman Parks Mankahlana also said claims Mobutu would not return to Kinshasa had been ""largely exaggerated."" But Western diplomats and military observers said some high-ranking Zairian military officers close to Mobutu had already left the country or sent their families out, apparently fearing Mobutu's imminent fall. The latest to leave was Gen. Kpama Baramoto, former army chief of staff, according to officials speaking on condition of anonymity. Another general, Etienne Nzimbi Ngbale, who commands Mobutu's presidential guard, has sent his family out of Zaire, they said. Meanwhile, in the city of Kenge, about 115 miles east of the capital, aid agencies reported Wednesday that 300 people may have been killed in fighting there. There was no independent verification of the claim. The Red Cross said 10 of its local workers in Kenge were among the dead. The rebels acknowledged Wednesday they were facing stiff resistance from government soldiers in Kenge, whose airport could serve as a staging ground for flying troops into Kinshasa to secure the international airport. The government insists it remains in control of the area and denies rebel allegations that mercenaries from Angola's former rebel movement are assisting Mobutu, who backed the guerrillas during Angola's 20-year civil war. Both Kabila and Mobutu have used foreign forces in their seven-month standoff. Kabila has received help from Uganda and Rwanda; Mobutu used mercenaries from eastern Europe. South Africa, which hosted the first face-to-face meeting between Mobutu and Kabila on a South African ship off the Congolese coast on Sunday, sought to arrange another round of talks for Wednesday, despite speculation the rebels would be in control of Kinshasa by then. Richardson said there was ""a good chance"" of a second meeting. The first round of talks provided no breakthroughs toward a peaceful settlement. Diplomats in the capital, however, have expressed doubts the two leaders would meet again. They say the best hope is to clear the way for a calm transfer of power in which Mobutu, 66, and ill with prostate cancer, resigns for health reasons and Kabila takes over as head of a transitional authority until elections. If Kabila fails to call early elections, they note, Western nations might withhold desperately needed aid. They also say that Kabila would be wise to hold elections quickly to take advantage of his wave of popularity and rising disgust with Mobutu.","""1997-05-08T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8980-000Y-K3WC-00000-00"""

He also appeared to rule out any partition of Zaire, but also said that retaining the territorial integrity of the country was ""not a problem for the alliance unless the Kinshasa regime remains in power."" The latest military advances by the rebels were ""successes for a popular army which is fighting mercenaries,"" Karaha added, stating that ""Mobutu is counting on two armies which carried out genocide in their own countries, Rwandan Hutus and Bosnian Serbs."" The government counter-claims that the rebels are backed by the Tutsi-led regimes in Rwanda and Burundi and by Uganda, which had been a home in exile for many of the Rwandan Tutsi rebel soldiers who seized power in Kigali after the 1994 genocide of more than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

Zaire accuses the Tutsi-led regimes in neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi of helping the rebels, together with Uganda, while foreign mercenaries, notably Bosnian Serbs, are known to be fighting with Zairean troops.

Rummelhardt said that ""as stressed in the plan drawn up by Mr. Mohamed Sahnoun, special representative of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity, the Zairean crisis will only be settled by dialogue, an electoral process and the convening of an international conference.

./samples/,"Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko left the capital Kinshasa Friday for the first face-to-face talks with rebel leader Laurent Kabila. Mobutu was sporting his signature leopard-skin cap and chatted with his wife and two sons on the tarmac before boarding the plane, which departed just after 11 a.m. local time (1000 GMT). South African President Nelson Mandela was also on his way to meet a naval vessel docked here, an indication that the Zaire peace talks he is to help mediate may indeed get under way. However, state television in Harare, Zimbabwe, on Friday quoted Kabila as saying the talks would be postponed until Saturday. ''I have been told the meeting will now be on Saturday because Mobutu has changed his mind again,''  Kabila told the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp. The state-controlled Herald newspaper reported Friday that Kabila flew unexpectedly into Harare Thursday to meet privately with President Robert Mugabe, who takes over as chairman of the Organization for African Unity in June. But Mandela Friday appeared confident the talks would go on as scheduled Friday. ''If I was not optimistic I wouldn't be going there,''  Mandela told reporters at Waterkloof Air Force Base before departing for Congo early Friday. Mandela was scheduled to meet Mobutu in this port city, where he will accompany him to the South African naval ship, the SAS Outeniqua. The Outeniqua will move out to international waters for the talks. The talks will be presided over by Mandela and U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun. ''I am convinced personally that both of them do want a settlement. There is not a clash in so far as they want Zaire to speak with one voice on almost all the issues affecting that country,''  Mandela said. South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki left Thursday for Luanda, Angola, where he was expected to meet Kabila and accompany him to the talks, said his spokesman Ricky Naidoo. When all parties are aboard the ship, it is expected to set sail for Soyo, an Angolan coastal town at the point where the Zaire-Angola borders meet. The ship will stay in international waters of Soyo. Mobutu, 66, has insisted he would never bow to Kabila's demand to resign, but he is ill with prostate cancer and under intense international pressure to step down. The United States and other countries want a cease-fire in Zaire's civil war, the establishment of a transitional government that includes rebels and opposition parties, and a plan for free, fair elections.

./samples/,"Text of report by Gabonese Africa No 1 radio on 12th July In Zaire, there is still confusion on the political scene. The joint statement signed by the radical opposition and Marshal President Mobutu Sese Seko's allies has made the situation worse. Following the communique from the Prime Minister's Office announcing a government reshuffle, the radical opposition and the president of the republic's political family denounced the continued presence of Leon Kengo Wa Dondo as prime minister. Kamanda wa Kamanda reports from Kinshasa: [Kamanda - recording] In a joint communique, the two constitutional political families that identify themselves as the Zairean political class took note of the resignation of the government on 10th July, the beginning of a new stage of the transition, according to the Political Forces of the Conclave and the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allies [Usoras]. Consequently, the document went on, the two political families have agreed on the dire need to set up a national unity government of which the prime minister will be presented after a consultation of the political class by the political group to which the head of state does not belong. This is in conformity with Article 78 of the transitional constitution and the protocol agreement on the political consultations, a particular arrangement, according to the document signed by Mendeo Malanga and Ndambito Bakato [names phonetic], spokesmen of Usoras and the presidential group, respectively. The same statement regards the consultation between Mobutu Sese Seko and Kengo Wa Dondo on 8th July in Gbadolite as being in line with normal cooperation between the president of the republic and the government, according to the provisions of Article 85 of the constitution. So, the presidential group and Usoras explained in their document, this consultation [words indistinct] by the political class which alone has the prerogative to appoint a prime minister to form a government. The following clarification is also necessary: by political class, we must understand the two constitutional political families - Political Forces of the Conclave on the one hand, and Usoras on the other, but not political leanings. There is currently therefore confusion on the Zairean political scene and the presidency of the republic does not want to get publicly involved in this affair at a time when people are expecting the convening of an extraordinary session of the High Council of the Republic - Transitional Parliament where the Kengo government is expected to give an account of its rule.

./samples/,"Having installed its own military ruler after overthrowing the country's Hutu president, Burundi's Tutsi-led army lifted a curfew on the streets of the capital Friday morning. Coup leaders acted to stop ''our people's descent into hell,''  newly installed leader Pierre Buyoya told the country in a nationwide radio broadcast. ''We demand that the international community understand the purpose of our efforts,''  said Buyoya, restored by the coup to a position he lost to a Hutu in a 1993 presidential election. ''What happened today was not a change of regime through ambition, glory or anything else.''  ''What happened today was an action of salvation,''  he said in his Thursday broadcast. Roadblocks were removed as people ventured onto the streets but soldiers continued to patrol the capital. Western leaders condemned the coup, fearing it could bring on ethnic warfare on the scale of neighboring Rwanda's genocide, but said nothing about sending troops to restore President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who headed a Tutsi-Hutu coalition government. Buyoya said in his radio address that Ntibantunganya (pronounced En-tee-bahn-toon-gan-yah) could safely leave his refuge at the U.S. ambassador's residence, and invited him participate in the effort to rebuild the country. The coup follows three years of civil war between the country's Hutus and Tutsis that has killed more than 150,000 people. Burundi's ethnic mix and hatred is similar to that of Rwanda, where Hutu militia slaughtered a half-million Tutsis and moderate Hutus two summers ago. The Rwandan genocide was prompted in part by Hutus' fears that Tutsis would try to regain the power they held until their monarchy was overthrown in 1959. In Burundi, however, the Tutsis have been in control since the country's independence in 1962. The military coup does not alter the balance of power; no matter who has occupied the presidency, Burundi's Tutsi-run military has always run the country. Burundi, a small mountainous country of about 11,000 square miles (28,000 square kilometers), lies on the northeast side of Lake Tanganyika and is bordered by Tanzania, Rwanda and Zaire. In a 10-minute address, Buyoya said his first mission as head of a transitional government will be ''to stop and quickly the massacres and all kinds of criminality that have been prevailing in Burundi for almost three years.''  Ntibantunganya, who took refuge at the U.S. ambassador's residence Tuesday night, has not resigned as leader of the country's fragile coalition government, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Judith Kaula said. The United States condemned the coup and called on military leaders to resolve the political crisis peacefully. U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the Organization of African Unity said the international community would not accept a Burundian government installed by force. Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who has tried to broker a peace deal for Burundi, called for sanctions against the new military regime. But Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo, who resigned late Wednesday, said he backed the coup and other countries were showing ignorance by condemning it. ''I accepted this change,''  Nduwayo told the BBC after he resigned on Wednesday. ''This is not a problem of the army, it is a problem of the whole nation of Burundi.''  ''It is a good thing in this circumstance. Of course I would like to see Hutus and Tutsis go back to democratic development,''  Nduwayo said. Buyoya, who overthrew Jean-Baptiste Bagaza in a 1987 coup, paved the way for Burundi's first free elections. He was defeated in June 1993 by Melchior Ndadaye, who became the nation's first Hutu resident.","""1996-07-26T00:00:00Z""","""3SKN-42M0-00BT-M3GR-00000-00"""
./samples/,"The rebels who captured Zaire's capital Saturday gave their country a new president, Laurent Desire Kabila, and a new name, the Democratic Republic of Congo. ''I am happy, very happy to succeed,''  Kabila said with a beaming smile at rebel headquarters in the southeastern mining town of Lubumbashi. Kabila, 56, has fought to oust President Mobutu Sese Seko since he became dictator 32 years ago. Mobutu, who is dying of prostate cancer, yielded power Friday. Kabila's forces swiftly captured Kinshasa as they did the rest of the country in the past eight months with little resistance. Some of Mobutu's soldiers heeded orders to surrender arms to the rebels, while generals and politicians fled across the Zaire River to Brazzaville, Congo. ''The war is over,''  said Bizima Karaha, rebel foreign minister. ''It is the end of one of the worst dictatorships that humanity has ever experienced.''  Brimming with confidence, Kabila announced a nine-point ''power-taking declaration''  that named him as president. ''Laurent Desire Kabila assumes from today the functions of head of state,''  Kabila said, reading a statement issued by his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo. Rebel leaders made the decision late Friday, he said, to avoid a power vacuum that could lead to conflict and bloodshed. Kabila said he had talked by telephone with Mobutu's generals, and ''everyone was ready to receive orders from me, it is clear.''  Putting on a pair of gold-framed glasses, Kabila read the statement in French. He sat at a table draped with the yellow-starred flag of the Democratic Republic of Congo, as the rebels call Zaire. Kabila said he would form ''a transitional government of national salvation''  within three days, and would convene an assembly within 60 days to write a new constitution. He made no mention of elections, which he previously has promised within a year of taking power. Senior officials of Mobutu's government were advised to continue in their posts. But many, including Prime Minister Gen. Likulia Bolongo, fled. Kabila was optimistic that he would succeed in rebuilding the country which has been declined under Mobutu's rule. ''I think we shall also succeed politically. We are confident, very confident,''  Kabila said. ''I have the support of my people.''  Karaha said the alliance would now begin to rebuild the country. ''The issue now is how to reconstruct our country, how to build a democracy, and a better life for all of our country,''  Karaha said. Rebel leaders many of them exiles with no political experience have, however, been short of specifics. Kabila has long promised elections within a year of taking power but he made no mention of a national ballot Saturday. Among his challenges will be convincing the country's 40 million people and more than 250 tribes, among Africa's most ethnically and politically fractious, that the alliance is a nationwide movement. Kabila urged calm in Kinshasa, and warned that anyone who harms Zairians or foreigners would be dealt with severely. The rebel leader said he was unconcerned about Mobutu's future. ''He can stay in his village, but I think it is not very important at all,''  he said.","""1997-05-17T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-5KR0-00BT-M3BV-00000-00"""

./samples/,"The former colonial power Belgium on Wednesday joined the list of countries that have granted grudging recognition of the new regime in the former Zaire, qualifed by concerns over democratization and human rights. South Africa, which brokered the peaceful departure of the deposed dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, gave its seal of approval Sunday, a day after Laurent Kabila declared himself president of the former Zaire and renamed it the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The United States gave its de facto recognition on Monday, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns saying: ""We had a relation with Zaire, we will now have a relation with the Democratic Republic of Congo."" Belgium also used the ""de facto"" formula and joined an international chorus of reservations over Kabila's intentions regarding democratization and the refugee situation. situation. Foreign ministry spokesman Andre Querton said: ""There is a new government which we recognize de facto,"" but added that Brussels did not envisage a ""formal act"" of recognition. Kabila on Saturday pledged to form a transitional government by Tuesday and to call a constituent assembly within 60 days. He is now expected to unveil his new government on Wednesday. Foreign Minister Erik Derycke, who had said that future ties were contingent on a transitional government, upcoming elections and a solution to the refugee crisis, welcomed ""encouraging statements"" by the Kabila regime on these issues. France--which like Britain and Germany recognizes states, not governments--has led calls for urgent attention to the plight of tens of thousands of Rwandan refugees in the DRC. Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by international indifference to the situation. The humanitarian aid group Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF - Doctors Without Borders) estimated that 340,000 refugees remain in the country, with the whereabouts of some 190,000 unknown. Several African and European diplomats in Geneva are pressing for new contacts with Kabila to authorize a mission investigating human rights abuses in the former Zaire. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his government was taking Kabila ""at his word"" for his promise to convene a constituent assembly and hold democratic elections. He repeated that Bonn was ready ""in principle"" to cooperate with the new regime. Kinkel, who had talks Wednesday with Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame, called on Rwanda to use its influence with Kabila to ""ensure an end to violence, respect for human rights and a democratic new start leading to free elections open to all democratic forces."" He pointed in particular to ""the unbearable situation"" of the refugees and urged access for aid agencies. Britain on Monday welcomed the changeover in power in Kinshasa ""without widespread violence,"" pledged to seek ""a constructive relationship"" with the new government and praised Kabila's vows on democratization. Meanwhile recognition by Uganda and Rwanda, staunch backers of Kabila's rebel movement, went without saying. The Tutsi-led Rwandan government announced its recognition late Monday, praising Kabila's ""momentous achievement."" Kigali had openly expressed its support for Kabila's forces when they began their offensive in the east of the country last year. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni congratulated Kabila and praised his ""heroic victory over the forces of backwardness"" in a message Monday to ""Your Excellency and Dear Brother."" Another ally, DRC's southern neighbor Zambia, welcomed the Kabila regime. President Frederick Chiluba officially recognised the Kabila regime Monday, saying: ""Zambia stands ready and stretches its open arms to working together with the new government."" Japan and China have remained cautious, Tokyo saying Tuesday it wanted Kabila to give guarantees on democratization before granting recognition. China also stopped short of recognizing the new regime, foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang saying: ""We are willing...to consolidate and develop friendly relations with the new government.""

./samples/,"U.N. officials expressed doubt on Monday that combat was going on in northern Angola despite state television's footage purportedly showing government troops fighting members of the UNITA political movement. State-run television TPA said its footage, which would be the first of fighting that has allegedly broken out since UNITA joined a unity government in April, showed government troops engaged in fierce, short-range combat with UNITA. But a U.N. spokesman said the footage was unconvincing. ''To me it looked like it had been staged for the cameras,''  spokesman David Wimhurst said of the footage broadcast Sunday and supposedly filmed the same day in the remote north of the country. The reports of battles, which were not independently verified, cast fresh doubt on the soundness of the country's United Nations-brokered peace process launched in 1994 after nearly two decades of civil war between the two sides. TPA claimed that its program, broadcast late Sunday, showed government forces backed by tanks and artillery fighting heavily-armed UNITA troops near the town of Luia in Lunda Norte province. The local army commander told TPA that his men were advancing against UNITA positions in a mopping-up operation after pushing the former rebels out of Luia. However, the footage did not show the opposing forces, merely a line of government soldiers walking through the bush and firing ahead. ''We know there has been some small-scale fighting, ambushes and skirmishes in the north between the two sides recently,''  Wimhurst said. ''The TAP footage did not show fighting, and as far as we have been able to ascertain, there have been no full-scale, set-piece battles.''  The U.N. mission overseeing the peace process said last week that tension was usual in the north where both sides are eager to control the region's lucrative diamond mines. According to the peace agreement, UNITA is supposed to hand over power to the government in areas still under its administration since the civil war ended. But the handover has been slow and the government is keen to reoccupy the diamond-mining areas which would provide much-needed foreign revenue to start rebuilding the war-devastated country. UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, claims that the government last month launched an offensive against areas still under UNITA control. The government says it is merely bolstering its positions on the border with Congo, formerly Zaire, to prevent the dregs of ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko's army from crossing into Angola. UNITA has a handful of seats in the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation, which was installed in April, and has troops in the unified national army, but claims that its officials are not being consulted in the decision-making process. The U.N. Security Council was due to discuss on Monday its future role in the vast southwest African nation where it has deployed a 6,000-strong force to monitor the peace process.

./samples/,"With rebels closer than ever to Zaire's capital, foreign mediators see talks today between President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila as a last chance to avoid a final bloody battle. Mobutu was expected to board a South African naval ship off the Congolese coast to meet again with Kabila, who is fighting to end Mobutu's 32 years of dictatorship. A similar meeting May 4 left two major issues unresolved: details of a transitional government, and when Mobutu would step down. Mobutu, 66 and ailing with cancer, refused to quit immediately, saying he would give up the presidency only after elections. The rebels insist Mobutu surrender power immediately to a transitional authority led by Kabila. South African President Nelson Mandela, a key mediator, was expected in Pointe-Noire, Congo, this morning. His deputy president, Thabo Mbeki, already had arrived and Kabila reportedly was on his way from Lubumbashi. ""They are all coming,"" South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said in Pointe-Noire. Meanwhile, Zaire's increasingly unpopular government imposed a curfew on Kinshasa on Tuesday and called on civilians to help the army defend the capital against the advancing rebels. Kabila's army claimed its fighters already were in Kinshasa. But there was no sign of fighting in the tense capital Tuesday night. And although the government reported heavy fighting on the road to the capital, spokesman Leon Kalima said the rebels were not yet in Kinshasa. The government said the 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew was called only to prevent looting and unrest, and that looters would be shot. Kabila's men have seized three-fourths of this vast nation since September, and government soldiers have looted many cities before retreating. A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebels were closer than ever to Kinshasa and had reached the Black River, about 60 miles outside the city. In Kinshasa, shops and stalls at the central market closed early. Long supermarket lines indicated some residents were stocking up on groceries. Plainclothes police roamed downtown, stopping people to demand bribes. In a bid to increase pressure on Mobutu to resign, opposition parties called for a general strike today to coincide with Mobutu-Kabila talks. A leaflet circulating on the streets urged civilians and soldiers to fly white flags and sing ""songs of joy"" to signify their support for the rebels. In Lubumbashi, in southeastern Zaire, rumors spread that Kinshasa had already fallen to the rebels. Joyous residents shot off firecrackers, ran through the streets cheering and singing, and sang funeral songs for Mobutu while chanting Kabila's name. Because of Mobutu's lack of support among both civilians and troops, Kabila's army has had a relatively easy time moving toward the capital. Soldiers in most cities have put up little resistance. But as the rebels moved closer to Kinshasa, fighting has increased. The rebels and some foreign diplomats say that's because of help from mercenaries including former Angolan rebels called in by Mobutu - a charge the government denies. The government, for its part, accuse the rebels of using Angolan government soldiers in their advance. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns on Monday had urged Americans to leave the city, telling them ""the end game is approaching.""

By 8:00 a.m. (0700 GMT) the firing appeared to have stopped, and a few groups of people were venturing onto the streets as some taxis began operating.

One Zairean Red Cross worker said he had counted 10 bodies and thought there were more. In a radio broadcast late Saturday, the rebels warned people in Kinshasa not to loot, steal or carry out acts of vandalism, saying they would be ""severely punished."" Residents in one district said the rebels had carried out night patrols to discourage violence and looting, but in another, people complained that alliance troops had not provided security. In Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-biggest city, the situation was calm. Kabila's announcement of his assumption of power Saturday was broadcast over rebel Voice of the People radio, but led to no outbursts of celebration. Last Tuesday, as part of its psycholgical warfare campaign, the rebel radio announced that the alliance troops had occupied the capital then.

Bob Anderson. Excited Zairians lined the road to the airport to welcome the rebel advance. Kabila rejected Mobutu's ceding of power to his government, saying that was not enough to stop the civil war. But in a victory speech, he said Mobutu no longer concerned him, and could remain in the home village to which he had fled on Friday. ''He can stay in his village, but I think it is not very important at all,''  Kabila said. He said there were few pockets of resistance and that Zairian army generals in Kinshasa had told him they were ''ready to receive orders from me.''  He referred to himself in the third person, saying: ''President Laurent Kabila will assume from now the functions of head of state.''  He would form a transitional government within 72 hours and within 60 days there would be a new constitution. Current government officials should remain in the posts and await orders from the alliance, he said. He made no mention of elections that the west has pressed him to call and has offered to fund. In recent weeks, Kabila has shied away from calling elections, saying Zaire was not ready. Mobutu's exact whereabouts and plans remained unclear. Aides said Friday he flew to his northern hometown of Gbadolite, 700 miles (1,125 kilometers) away, for a few days ''rest''  and refused to say he had left Kinshasa for good. But diplomatic sources said they expected the 66-year-old Mobutu, who is dying from prostate cancer, to continue on to Morocco to begin life in exile. Kabila has promised to undo the damage wrought by Mobutu's nearly 32 years in power. But he has been short on specifics, and his troops have been accused of atrocities against refugees during their eight-month march across Zaire.

./samples/,"KINSHASA, March 25 (AFP) - Zaire's government is offering to ""share power"" with the rebels who have seized control of one-quarter of the country, Zaire's vice-premier Banza Mukalay told AFP Tuesday. Talks have not yet started but a rebel spokesman said preliminary talks on a peace settlement between the rebels and the Kinshasa authorities could begin early next month. A rebel spokesman in the northern city of Kisangani said preliminary peace talks would probably be held in South Africa in early April. ""There's a good chance that preparatory meetings will take place in South Africa at the beginning of April,"" laying the ground for a face-to-face meeting between Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila, rebel ""justice minister"" Kongolo Mwenze said. said. The government's offer to bring the rebels into some form of government came as Mobutu appointed a seven-member ""negotiating committee"" made up of representatives of the presidency, the judicial system, the government, parliament and opposition to meet the rebels, Mobutu's spokesman Kabuya Lumuna told state television late Tuesday. The moves came on the eve of a regional summit in Lome, Togo, where African foreign ministers called for ""immediate negotiations"" between the Zairean government and rebel forces. The Lome summit is the first occasion the rebels have been invited to an international conference, and is being seen as a test of the importance of the Organisation of African Unity itself. As well as OAU powers, both the United States and France will have special emmissaries present: Howard Wolpe and Michel Dupuch, respectively. Washington and Paris also demanded that the two sides agree talks. In an interview with AFP in Kinshasa, Banza, who is also vice-president of the ruling party, said the government wanted to bring the rebels into the national unity government proposed by Mobutu. ""We have decided to share power--that includes with the rebellion--during the transition,"" he said. The Zairean government resigned Monday but remains the transitional administration. Banza said the party had arrived at the decision because of the need to see through elections. ""A ceasefire, the elections and sharing power should be discussed with the rebellion,"" he added. Mwemze meanwhile said the rebels hoped opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi would refuse to take on the position of prime minister following the sacking last week of Kengo Wa Dondo. ""We hope it will not be him (Kengo),"" he said. ""It is up to him to decide, but he must know that if he accepts, he will be categorised....If he accepts, he will be our enemy. If he swears allegiance to Mobutu, he will be the enemy to overcome. Anyone who accepts to be prime minister will automatically be our enemy."" Tshisekedi, the popular leader of Zaire's moderate opposition, has been seen as a possible successor to Kengo whose departure has compounded the disarray of the Zairean leadership. Kabila had said earlier Tuesday that the hundreds of American, French, Belgian and British troops deployed to Brazzaville, Congo, for a possible evacuation of 3,000 foreign nationals were ""a threat to peace"" and an attempt by ""neo-colonialists"" to pressure the rebels. However, in Paris, Congo's President Pascal Lissouba rejected Kabila's charge. ""Congo and Brazzaville are not an integral part of Zaire,"" he said. ""Even if they are at the gates of Zaire, they are in Congo,"" Lissouba said on French radio. According to a World Food Programme (WFP) worker, tens of thousands of refugees, ""a human river"", were on the march from Ubundu to Kisangani. Some 14,000 of them had already set up camp seven kilometres (five miles) from the city. ""We absolutely must get to negotiations"" Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema told AFP. ""We must above all go to the aid of our brothers who are dying....There are columns of refugees in the forest who don't know where they are going."" bur/db/pcj AFP A two-man delegation from Zaire's rebel alliance arrived in Lome, Togo, on Tuesday evening to attend an Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit on the crisis in their country. The two men, Bizima Karaha and Gaetan Kakudji, arrived on a scheduled Sabena flight coming from Brussels and Paris. They were met by Togo's Foreign Minister Koffi Pannou and taken to their hotel. They made no comment to journalists at the airport. The daughter of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko was on the same flight. The rebels had earlier said in Kisangani they would not negotiate at the summit but would present the objectives of the rebel alliance, led by Laurent-Desire Kabila, to the dozen heads of state participating in the summit.

./samples/,"By Michael Adler KINSHASA, April 2 (AFP) - Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko on Wednesday appointed long-time rival Etienne Tshisekedi as prime minister, presidential spokesman Kabuya Lumina told AFP. Tshisekedi replaces Kengo wa Dondo who was forced to resign last month over his failure to stop rebels led by Laurent-Desire Kabila taking over one quarter of the country. The presidential decree signed by Mobutu was to be broadcast in the evening on national radio and television, Kabuya said. Tshisekedi was premier twice earlier in the 1990s but was ousted both times by Mobutu. mobutu. The 64-year-old opposition figure was chosen by the opposition on Tuesday as their candidate for the premiership. Tshisekedi, 64, had been a minister many times before he broke with Mobutu in the 1980s to found the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, then an illegal party. He is considered the leader of the opposition and a man Mobutu wanted to keep away from political office in order to avoid empowering a rival. The opposition has been split among the popular Tshisekedi, his rival Kibassa Maliba and outgoing premier Kengo Wa Dondo. However, though he is an opponent of the ailing president, the rebels earlier scoffed at the news that he was expected to be nominated. In the rebel stronghold of Goma in eastern Zaire, senior rebel official Gaetan Kakudji warned: ""If Tshisekedi wants to steer a wretched ship, he must learn to swim because it is going to sink."" ""He will be the prime minister of Mobutu, they will be on the same ship. He would be agreeing to steer a ship we call Mobutu,"" he added. While politicians have bickered in Kinshasa over the past few weeks, the rebels have continued to strengthen their hand, capturing more territory as they advance in the southeast on Zaire's second largest city, Lubumbashi. This has put the rebels in a position of strength ahead of peace talks set for South Africa this weekend. In Zaire, the president and prime minister have to be from different parties. Zairean charge d'affaires Issa Ganda told AFP that an eight-member government delegation, led by Mobutu's envoy Honore Ngabanda Nzambo, will likely arrive in Johannesburg on Thursday on a scheduled Air Zaire flight. Zairean rebels in Goma said that South Africa was sending a plane to pick up their delegation Thursday. According to Gaetan Kakudji, deputy secretary general of Kabila's rebel alliance, the rebels would be negotiating ""the departure of Mobutu and his clique,"" not to take on the mantle of the main political opposition to his regime. ""As soon as we reach an accord (with Mobutu's regime), any ceasefire will be automatic,"" Kakudji said. On November 21 last year, after meeting Mobutu in France, where the president was convalescing from cancer, Tshisekedi had declared himself prime minister of a ""national unity government."" Kengo finally resigned on March 24. This left a 10-day period for the opposition to name a prime minister, who must be rubber-stamped by Mobutu. Tshisekedi was premier for just a few days in October 1991, after Kinshasa was hit by looting and riots and Mobutu was forced to make moves to go from a single- to a multi-party state. A transitional ruling council nominated Tshisekedi again in 1992, but a year later he was again dismissed after more violence in Kinshasa. However since then has considered himself still prime minister. In another development, a UN human rights rapporteur said in Geneva Wednesday that Zairean rebels had carried out about 40 massacres during their six-month offensive in eastern Zaire, citing witnesses and other sources. But rapporteur Roberto Garreton dismissed as ""unlikely"" published estimates that up to 500,000 people had been killed. msa/pcj/gk AFP The United States called on Zairean rebel leader Laurent Desire Kabila Wednesday to allow international agencies to begin an airlift operation of starving refugees near Kisangani. The State Department also voiced hope that new Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi will make a negotiated peace with rebels in eastern Zaire his first order of business. According to Washington, some 80,000 refugees are in need of emergency aid near Kisangani, which was captured by the rebels on March 15. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Kabila must give his consent to aid workers to bring emergency supplies to refugees and begin airlift operations in the region as planned on Friday. ""We call for urgent approval by him and consent of this UNHCR refugee repatriation plan and the assistance operations so that further deaths and suffering can be prevented,"" said Burns. The State Department on Monday granted an additional three million dollars to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to allow aid workers to contract an aircraft for the airlift. ""But in order for that particular airlift operation to succeed, it does need the permission and the consent of Mr. Kabila,"" Burns said.

./samples/,"A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ''i''  or ''f''  category codes: ROQUEBRUNE-CAP-MARTIN, France (AP) Wearing his trademark leopard-skin cap, Zaire's president left his French villa early Tuesday to prove he is still in control of his country shaken by a rebel incursion. Mobutu Sese Seko was returning to his homeland for the first time in four months, a period of rebellion and violence in Zaire that humiliated the army and galvanized the opposition. The 66-year-old president was recovering in France from prostate cancer treatment. Scores of opposition activists in the Zairian capital of Kinshasa have said Mobutu's return would be welcome only if it led to his ouster in elections promised for May. He has ruled Zaire for 31 years. NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) African leaders ended a one-day summit with a call Tuesday for an end to rebel incursions into Zaire to keep the giant nation whole. But it is difficult to imagine what kind of impact, if any, the decisions will have on the Great Lakes region of central Africa, plagued by divisions exacerbated by the Hutu-Tutsi power struggle in Rwanda and Burundi. The nine African leaders said that since 640,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees had returned from eastern Zaire, their approach should concentrate on encouraging a negotiated settlement between the Tutsi-led rebels and the government. Zaire wasn't represented at the summit. NGARA, Tanzania (AP) The Tanzanian government allowed aid workers into Hutu refugee camps on Tuesday, but warned them only to feed people from Burundi those from Rwanda are expected to go home. The aid workers spread out to do sanitation work in camps where refugees remain, hoping to prevent diseases from spreading, Anne Willem Bijleveld, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency, said in Ngara. Some 43,000 refugees crossed into Rwanda Tuesday morning, but Bijleveld said 80,000 to 100,000 Rwandan Hutus still were hiding in forests outside the camps. That, too, he warned, could pose a health problem. JERUSALEM (AP) Calling Israel's prime minister unfit to rule, 40 Israeli legislators used a new law Tuesday to try and remove Benjamin Netanyahu from power seven months after his election. The law stipulates that the prime minister can be ousted if at least 80 of the 120 members of parliament vote to have him removed. In such a case, new elections would be held for prime minister, but not for parliament. The attempt appears doomed to failure because Netanyahu's ruling coalition controls 66 seats in parliament. However, parliament will have to hold a special debate within 30 days on the prime minister's competence. MOSCOW (AP) Six Red Cross workers were killed early Tuesday at a hospital in Chechnya, one of the most serious outbreaks of violence since a fragile peace took hold in the breakaway republic. Unidentified attackers broke into the hospital compound at Novye Atagi, 17 kilometers (11 miles) southwest of Grozny, the Chechen capital, said Bertrand Kern, deputy head of the Moscow delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross. All six victims were expatriates, but their names and nationalities were not immediately available, Kern said. Another expatriate worker was wounded. The ITAR-Tass news agency said the aid workers were shot at close range. BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) Their feet bloodied, 17 students who walked for 48 hours arrived in Belgrade early Tuesday in hopes of presenting their demands for democracy to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The students marched 240 kilometers (150 miles) from Nis, the second-largest Serbian city, in a symbolic protest against the overturning of victories by Milosevic's opponents in Nov. 17 elections. After a month of protests, Milosevic returned their victory in Nis on Sunday and in the town of Smederevska Palanka on Monday. But Milosevic's foes are demanding more, and the Nis marchers said their protest was intended to help other Serb cities get their election results back.","""1996-12-17T00:00:00Z""","""3SKN-2TN0-00BT-M42F-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Desperate to prevent an all-out attack on the Zairian capital, a U.S. envoy pressed rebels Monday to enter Kinshasa peacefully, and shuttled around Africa to talk with their leader and the influential men who back him. Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, urged restraint during the eight days that rebel leader Laurent Kabila has given President Mobutu Sese Seko to resign or be chased out of Kinshasa. ''He has to choose to relinquish power and he is safeguarded, or he perishes with his power,''  Kabila said in this southeastern rebel stronghold a day after peace talks with Mobutu. The rebels said in a statement they would guarantee Mobutu's safety and that of his family if he resigned now. Kabila's 70,000-strong rebel army has captured more than three-quarters of Zaire in its drive to end Mobutu's nearly 32-year dictatorship. Kabila said the vanguard of his forces was 40 miles (65 kilometers) from Kinshasa's international airport and would be at the outskirts of the city of 6 million in a few days. Asked what would happen if Mobutu ignored his timetable, Kabila said: ''He will be chased from the power, pushed out of Kinshasa in a few days.''  Mobutu and Kabila apparently made little progress toward ending the seven-month war in talks Sunday aboard a South African naval ship docked in Pointe Noire, Congo, agreeing only to meet again within 10 days. Richardson met with Kabila for an hour Monday and said he was encouraged by Kabila's conciliatory tone toward Mobutu. The former New Mexico congressman who built a reputation for concluding tricky negotiations in North Korea and Sudan said he delivered an urgent message to Kabila from U.S. President Bill Clinton. ''We stressed our longstanding view that for the benefit of the Zairian people...there should be a peaceful entry into the capital of Kinshasa a soft landing which avoids violence and chaos,''  Richardson said. The United States also wants an ''inclusive''  transitional government and fair and open elections, he said. Mobutu, 66, who is seriously ill with prostate cancer, agreed that a transitional authority should be established to organize elections. He said he would hand over power to an elected authority. Kabila, whose forces control all but Zaire's far north and west, demands Mobutu immediately transfer power to the rebel alliance. Asked about Kabila on Monday, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said U.S. officials ''don't have a thorough assessment of him as a political leader.''  The United States and other western powers have troops stationed across the Zaire River in Congo and offshore to evacuate their nationals from Kinshasa, if needed. Unpaid, undisciplined Zairian soldiers have been looting towns across Zaire, then running away just before a rebel onslaught. A rebel assault on the capital could provoke looting and mayhem that would make evacuations more likely. However, the streets of Kinshasa were calm Monday, with no signs of panic and little evidence of army preparations. After meeting Monday with Kabila, Richardson headed to Botswana to speak with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who was attending a conference in the southern African country. He met in Kigali, Rwanda, on Sunday with Defense Minister Paul Kagame. Both men, whom Richardson referred to as ''big players''  in the Zaire conflict, are widely believed to back Kabila with troops and weapons. They are interested in seeing Mobutu fall because he backed the former extremist Hutu regime in Rwanda that was behind the slaughter of a half-million Tutsis in 1994. Museveni is from the small group of Bahima people in western Uganda, who are related to the Tutsis.","""1997-05-05T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-5G10-00BT-M469-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Burundi's Tutsi-led army has installed its own military ruler, sealed the borders and ordered civilians off the streets after overthrowing the country's Hutu president. Coup leaders acted to stop ''our people's descent into hell,''  newly installed leader Pierre Buyoya told the country Thursday in a nationwide radio broadcast. ''We demand that the international community understand the purpose of our efforts,''  said Buyoya, restored by the coup to a position he lost to a Hutu in a 1993 presidential election. ''What happened today was not a change of regime through ambition, glory or anything else.''  ''What happened today was an action of salvation,''  he said. Western leaders condemned the coup, fearing it could bring on ethnic warfare on the scale of neighboring Rwanda's genocide, but said nothing about sending troops to restore President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who headed a Tutsi-Hutu coalition government. Soldiers and police patrolled the central African nation's capital, deserted under army orders to civilians to close businesses and stay at home. Troops shut the airport, and a dozen paratroopers patrolled the state-run TV station, which was surrounded by barbed wire. The coup follows three years of civil war between the country's Hutus and Tutsis that has killed more than 150,000 people. The two-day-old army uprising apparently has been free of violence, although there were reports that the country's main Hutu opposition party would try to lay siege to Bujumbura and Gitega, U.N. Undersecretary-General Chinmaya Gharekhan said in New York. Burundi's ethnic mix and hatred is similar to that of Rwanda, where Hutu militia slaughtered a half-million Tutsis and moderate Hutus two summers ago. The Rwandan genocide was prompted in part by Hutus' fears that Tutsis would try to regain the power they held until their monarchy was overthrown in 1959. In Burundi, however, the Tutsis have been in control since the country's independence in 1962. The military coup does not alter the balance of power; no matter who has occupied the presidency, Burundi's Tutsi-run military has always run the country. Burundi, a mountainous country about the size of New Hampshire, lies on the northeast side of Lake Tanganyika and is bordered by Tanzania, Rwanda and Zaire. ''The politicians have failed to solve the problems, and we have decided the country cannot continue like this,''  military spokesman Lt. Col Longin Minani said Thursday. ''Buyoya is more experienced, he is democratic and most people will respect him,''  he said. In a 10-minute address, Buyoya said his first mission as head of a transitional government will be ''to stop and quickly the massacres and all kinds of criminality that have been prevailing in Burundi for almost three years.''  Ntibantunganya, who took refuge at the U.S. ambassador's residence Tuesday night, has not resigned as leader of the country's fragile coalition government, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Judith Kaula said. ''This is not the worst-case scenario, because it's not your classic bloody coup in the middle of the night,''  she said. At least eight other Hutus, among them three prominent politicians, sought refuge Thursday in the German ambassador's residence. The United States condemned the coup and called on military leaders to resolve the political crisis peacefully. ''We believe now this meets anybody's definition of a coup d'etat because we've now heard directly the intentions of the coup leaders,''  State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Thursday. U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the Organization of African Unity said the international community would not accept a Burundian government installed by force. The Tutsi-led military should ''recognize that a coup d'etat will not solve any of Burundi's problems and is only likely to intensify violence on all sides,''  Boutros-Ghali said in a statement. Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who has tried to broker a peace deal for Burundi, called for sanctions against the new military regime. U.N. officials were working on two contingency plans one to provide aid if the country collapses in violence and the other to send troops to Burundi to prevent ethnic slaughter. Only Zambia, Malawi and Chad have offered soldiers, however. Tutsi paratroopers surrounded government buildings in the capital late Tuesday, forcing Ntibantunganya (pronounced En-tee-bahn-toon-gan-yah) to flee the palace. Buyoya, who overthrew Jean-Baptiste Bagaza in a 1987 coup, paved the way for Burundi's first free elections. He was defeated in June 1993 by Melchior Ndadaye, who became the nation's first Hutu president. Before Thursday's announcement of Burundi's new president, thousands of youths demonstrated against Buyoya, whom they accuse of fostering political dissent in Burundi. ''Buyoya is the father of disorder,''  one banner said. In Bujumbura, a radio broadcast told people to go home. Military checkpoints were set up on main roads, cutting off the airport, university and suburbs. Streets quickly emptied except for troops and a few playing children. On Burundi Radio, Defense Minister Lt. Col. Firmin Sinzoyiheba warned any additional demonstrations would be punished severely. ''For three years, Burundi was facing a terrible situation where people were dying day after day,''  he said, referring to the ethnic violence sparked by Ndadaye's 1993 assassination by Tutsi army paratroopers four months after he took office. Rwanda accuses the United Nations of standing aside in 1994 as Hutu troops and allied militiamen slaughtered 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis.","""1996-07-25T00:00:00Z""","""3SKN-4300-00BT-M4CS-00000-00"""

./samples/,"[8] Text of report by Zairean radio on 22nd August The Steering Committee of the Union of Independent Democrats UDI held one of its regular meetings yesterday at the party headquarters. After expressing satisfaction with the massive mobilization by the Kinshasa UDI branch on the occasion of the installation of the grassroots committee of the word indistinct (?zone), the steering committee reviewed the political situation in the country and wishes to bring the following to the knowledge of the general public: 1. The UDI fully supports the government's decision to repatriate all Rwandan refugees to enable them to take part in the rebuilding of their country. Consequently, it urges the transitional government to continue this exercise until the last refugee returns to his country and to take all the necessary steps to fight to the end any attempt from whatever quarters (?to frustrate) Zaireans' determination to remain masters of their land. 2. The UDI deplores the bloody incidents which marred the Unified Lumumbist Party-organized march. On the other hand, it expresses delight at the order that characterized the march organized on Friday 18th August, by the two wings coexisting within the brotherly and friendly party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress UDPS . Our party is satisfied to note that after the UPDS federations of Equateur, Nord-Kivu, Sud-Kivu, Shaba and Kasai Occidental, those of Kinshasa have also had the courage to declare their commitment to the fundamental principles of democracy and freedom of thought. This notwithstanding, the UDI wishes to recall that at this conflict-free transition period when all persuasions are represented at the High Council of the Republic - Transitional Parliament, which is accepted by all as the only source of legitimacy, the flexing of muscles in the streets is as pointless as it is dangerous for the security of goods and persons. Consequently, UDI urges the country's authorities to adopt the appropriate measures that would forestall any unpleasant consequences that could result from the abuse of the freedom of expression guaranteed every Zairean. This communique, issued by the UDI, is signed by Zozo Golla Sinkela Mpaka, party secretary-general.","""1995-08-24T00:00:00Z""","""3S51-N7G0-0017-G0NB-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Opposition leaders brought the capital to a virtual standstill today to press demands for President Mobutu Sese Seko to step down as Zaire's spreading rebellion celebrated fresh gains in the south. In a protest billed by supporters as the ""dead city"" strike, streets here were eerily deserted. Shops, offices and public transportation were shut down throughout the day as residents of this normally bustling city of 4.5 million heeded the opposition's call to stay at home. The strike was organized by supporters of the recently dismissed Prime Minister, Etienne Tshisekedi. It was part of what has emerged as an undeclared race between him and the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, for control over Kinshasa and credit for bringing Mr. Mobutu down, Zairian political analysts and foreign diplomats said. But as if to emphasize the ascendancy of his rebellion, Mr. Kabila flew today to the capital of Zaire's southern copper belt, Lubumbashi, the country's second-largest city, where his arrival drew large crowds of well-wishers. The strike by Mr. Tshisekedi's followers in the capital was seen as a blunt challenge to Mr. Mobutu's authority and to his decrees last week setting up a new military-led Government and imposing a state of emergency. Before being removed last week, Mr. Tshisekedi was prevented by soldiers from entering his office after a violent crackdown on a rally of his supporters. ""Today we have a dead city, dead villages, dead schools and a dead country,"" said Andre Kyushe, a supporter of Mr. Tshisekedi who manned a barricade in a Kinshasa suburb. ""What we are waiting for is a dead Mobutu, and we won't stop now until he is out of the way."" Flouting Government warnings against public protests, opposition leaders said they would step up civil disobedience over the next two days by closing schools and commandeering vehicles for raucous motorized protests. On Wednesday, they are planning a massive anti-Government demonstration. ""This is the sixth year of our struggle against Mobutu, and there is no way we are going to back down just because a general gives an order,"" said Mukendi wa Mulumba, a senior official in Mr. Tshisekedi's party, the Union for Social Progress and Democracy. ""We fear a violent reaction and an explosion, but we are confident in our people."" Last week the rebel movement, which calls itself the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, gave Mr. Mobutu, 66, an ultimatum to begin talks on his resignation within 72 hours or face a resumption of the rebel army's one-sided war against what has been a completely ineffective national army. The next day, Saturday, Mr. Mobutu called Mr. Kabila a ""gang leader,"" and said that he would only begin discussions with him if the rebel leader addressed him ""politely."" The rebel response was swift and menacing: an announcement that the President had run out of chances to talk and would now be forced out of power and into exile. After watching the rebels capture half or more of Zaire's territory, including three of its four largest cities and almost all of its mineral resources, few people here doubt that the rebellion can make good on its threats. But for now, foreign diplomats here dismiss rebel claims of being as near as 160 miles to Kinshasa and believe that the most advanced rebel troops in the central city of Kananga, about 500 miles to the east. The next and last major city between the rebels and Kinshasa, analysts say, is Kikwit, which may take as long as two weeks for the rebels to reach. With Mr. Mobutu's army in collapse, the rebels' biggest challenge has been the great distances between cities in a country one-third the size of the United States. Throughout most of their seven-month war, rebel forces have moved without motorized vehicles, advancing by foot or in dugout canoes and typically covering anywhere from 20 and 60 miles a day, depending on the terrain. ""The only military obstacle now between the rebels and Kinshasa is the state of the roads,"" said one regional military expert. ""And they are just about the worst in Africa."" For many here the most immediate question is whether fighting or widespread panic and looting can be avoided in the capital. In most of his major conquests, Mr. Kabila has destabilized cities days or even weeks ahead of time by spreading rumors, planting tracts and using infiltrators. Unpaid and untrained Government soldiers eventually grow so uneasy over the prospects of a confrontation that they flee even before the rebels arrive, often pillaging cities as they abandon them. Kinshasa has a history of devastating army riots, and with the deeply corrupt political establishment here already on edge over the arrival of a score-settling revolutionary regime, many residents and diplomats fear that little more than a spark could set off a conflagration. Diplomats here say they hope that Mr. Kabila realizes this danger. Even as he and Mr. Tshisekedi size each other up and employ divergent tactics against the Government, diplomats said they would like to see the rebel leader build political bridges to Kinshasa and find ways to put the army here at ease before he arrives. ""If he is intelligent, he comes in here with allies in place--military and civilian,"" said one Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""The last thing you would want is to have 10,000 to 15,000 Government soldiers all disappearing with their weapons, and the old political class trying to organize them into resistance because they are bitter over a lack of power-sharing."" But so far Mr. Kabila has expressed no desire to include Zaire's opposition leaders in a transitional government. Several other recent moves by the rebel leader will also undoubtedly be seen as provocative by Mr. Mobutu's allies and those of Mr. Tshisekedi. Two weeks ago, days before the rebellion had swept into Zaire's diamond-mining capital of Mbuji-Mayi, the head of the state diamond firm, Jonas Mukamba, took a major risk and announced that he would be willing to cooperate with Mr. Kabila. Still, Mr. Mukamba was reportedly arrested and flown off to the eastern, rebel-held city of Goma, where he is believed to be under interrogation over the company's finances. Today the Governor of Shaba Province, Kyungu wa Kumwanza, a popular local opposition politician, was removed by Mr. Kabila and replaced by a high-ranking rebel officer who is a cousin of the rebel leader. Mr. Kyungu was ousted even after he had helped defuse tensions as the rebels approached Lubumbashi, spreading word that the rebels were welcome, preaching against pillaging and calling on Mr. Mobutu to resign. ""This is not a very good sign,"" said one diplomat. ""People try to reach arrangements with Kabila and he sweeps them aside. What that leaves a lot of people wondering is if he isn't just going to be another Mobutu.""","""1997-04-15T00:00:00Z""","""3SP8-8340-000P-N4B1-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko must ""face reality"" that his leadership days have ended, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Tuesday. ""We believe the era of Mobutu is over,"" said Burns. ""It is imperative that the Zaireans move on to something better and something more durable. ""And we hope that's democracy, via elections,"" said Burns, adding, ""He alone can decide that question. But I think the United States has made very clear that we believe his era is over."" over."" Burns would not confirm that President Bill Clinton told Mobutu the same thing through his emissary Bill Richardson, US ambassador to the United Nations. Burns said Richardson took with him on his current peace mission to Zaire a letter in French that ""reflected American policy and stated American policy and gave some advice based on American policy."" Richardson left here for Zaire late Sunday as US President Bill Clinton's special envoy, chiefly aiming to bring the Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila together for face-to-face talks. Burns said a US role in facilitating Mobutu's departure from the country he has ruled for 32 years is not ""a factor in the present situation."" Instead, he said, Mobutu, suffering from prostate cancer, must accept the situation and go of his own accord. Burns said he did not know where Mobutu kept his overseas bank accounts, adding that the United States did not envisage intervening in the issue of the failing ruler's assets. The spokesman said the US government has clearly signalled its intention over the last two weeks that Mobutu resign and make way for a transition to democracy. Burns also warned Kabila and his rebel alliance that they ""must bear responsibility for what happens to innocent people in the regions that they occupy."" Burns referred to ""a growing body of credible evidence that massacres have taken place in rebel-held territory."" He reiterated his plea to the rebels to cooperate fully with the United Nations and humanitarian organizations to help and evacuate the hundreds of thousands of refugees in eastern Zaire. Also on Tuesday South African President Nelson Mandela proclaimed a ""major breakthrough"" in Zairean peace efforts with a meeting of Zaire's president and rebel leaders forthcoming, Mandela's spokesman said. Mandela, who has led diplomatic efforts to end Zaire's seven-month civil war, was ""very excited"" that President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila had agreed on a venue for a meeting, the spokesman said. avz/hh/pfm By Kevin McElderry KINSHASA, April 29 (AFP) - Zairean rebels on Tuesday moved into parts of Kikwit, a strategic site in their offensive westwards, some 450 kilometres (280 miles) by road from the capital Kinshasa, sources close to the rebels said. Kikwit lies on a major strategic road junction and is a key town for food deliveries to the capital. With 300,000 inhabitants, it has little industry, but made headlines in May 1995 with an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, which was finally contained. Sources close to Laurent Kabila's rebel alliance at their base in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi said rebels were in Kikwit, but that government troops still held the airport there. The coordinator of the Bandundu region crisis committee set up in Kikwit to prevent looting, Father Dominique Kahanga, said that rebel troops arrived on Tuesday morning after government soldiers left without a fight. However, Zairean Information Minister Kin Key Mulumba on Tuesday said reports that Kikwit had fallen were ""pure deception"". Rebel leaders in Lubumbashi would not confirm the reports. If confirmed, nevertheless, the fall of Kikwit would prove a serious blow to President Mobutu Sese Seko's beleaguered regime, following the seizure of more than half the vast country to the rebels since October. International efforts were under way Tuesday to bring about direct talks between Mobutu and Kabila. US envoy Bill Richardson, the US ambassador to the United Nations, was set to meet Mobutu late Tuesday morning in a delicate mediation, before flying to Lubumbashi for talks with Kabila. A US diplomat in Lubumbashi, Zaire's second city, said that Richardson will on Wednesday go to Kisangani, the third largest town, in a region where some 85,000 desperate Rwandan Hutu refugees have disappeared amid reports of fighting. Richardson arrived in Kinshasa on Monday on a mediation mission ordered by US President Bill Clinton to bolster efforts to reach a peace agreement. Mobutu and Kabila are expected to hold face-to-face talks this week on a South African naval vessel, which has begun sailing towards the Zairean coast in readiness, source close to negotiations said in Pretoria on Tuesday. ""The meeting should take place before the end of the week, if they don't change their minds,"" said the source, who demanded anonymity. South African officials and the UN-OAU special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun on April 16 said talks between the two men would take place ""very soon"" in South Africa. However since then Mobutu, who is recovering from cancer surgery, has said he did not want to go to South Africa, citing poor health. He said he preferred French-speaking Gabon or Congo. Western diplomatic sources have indicated that, in diplomatic terms, Richardson will urge Mobutu to quit power gracefully after 32 years of dictatorship. Observers here however said it was unlikely that the president, who has seen his erstwhile allies in the West withdraw support one by one, will give up so easily. Mobutu insists on the right to stand in presidential elections while Kabila, whose forces have captured more than half this huge nation, says he must resign. UN diplomats said Richardson would try to persuade Kabila to be more flexible, and to convince both men to meet despite disagreement over a venue. Another of his tasks is to assess the humanitarian situation in the northeast after the Rwandan Hutu refugees disappeared from their camps south of Kisangani. Relief workers located up to 10,000 of them Monday, hungry, sick and frightened. Kabila has given the United Nations just two months to repatriate them all to Rwanda, sparking protests from western leaders and the United Nations. ""There is a humanitarian crisis here and the international community must respond,"" Richardson acknowledged Monday. He called for a negotiated settlement to the conflict and the formation of a transitional government to lead the country to elections. The envoy was expected to travel to Angola, and possibly Gabon as well, US officials in Washington said Monday. km-bur/nb/ml ml","""1997-04-29T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-38S0-0025-F4MJ-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu lost a vote of no confidence in Parliament on Monday and was fired by President Pasteur Bizimungu. Government spokesman Tom Ndahiro said the president had asked for the vote of no-confidence, telling Parliament that Twagiramungu had not fulfilled the objectives of the government. Charles Murigande, a senior aid to the President, would not disclose specifics, but said Twagiramungu was sacked for incompetence. ''He really hasn't delivered,''  said Murigande. Twagiramungu, who has led the government since it was formed in July 1994 after Tutsi-led rebels drove the former regime into exile, was not immediately available for comment. Murigande said the prime minister wrote a letter of resignation to the president after the vote in Parliament. The text of the letter was not released. However, Murigande said the firing apparently came as a surprise to Twagiramungu, who earlier Monday was inviting ministers to a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Parliament voted 55-0 with six abstentions to back the president's request to fire Twagiramungu. Twagiramungu, a moderate Hutu, is not a member of the dominant Rwandan Patriotic Front and has often been at odds with the policies of the Tutsi-dominated rebel movement that seized power last summer. Ndahiro said a new prime minister could be named as early as Tuesday and that a reshuffle of the Cabinet was possible. After three months of renewed war, The Rwandan Patriotic Front defeated the government army in July 1994 and drove the Hutu-dominated government into exile in Zaire. The civil war was rekindled after President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundi President Cyprian Ntaryamira were killed in a mysterious April 6, 1994, plane crash in Kigali. Hutu militants and security forces immediately went on a murderous rampage that left at least 500,000 people, mostly minority Tutsis, dead. Although he was not a member of the rebel movement, Twagiramungu, the leader of the opposition Democratic Republican Movement Party, was selected to head the new government because he was designated in a 1993 peace accord to head a new government of national unity. That transitional government was being formed when the president was killed and the Hutu extremists launched their campaign of genocide. The new government took over a country shattered by civil war and the genocide. The former regime looted the treasury, leaving the new government no money to rebuild the infrastructure and the economy. More than 2 million Rwandans, mostly Hutus, fled the country after the rebel victory. Because of the exodus and the genocide, Rwanda has found itself without the manpower and expertise to restart its justice system to punish the perpetrators of the genocide. It also lacks the money, manpower and equipment to carry out other usual functions of government.","""1995-08-28T00:00:00Z""","""3SJD-VFY0-0070-14T2-00000-00"""

./samples/,"Politicians and troops are eagerly awaiting the return of Zaire's long-absent leader, President Mobutu Sese Seko, who is due in the capital Tuesday to tackle the mounting political and military crisis sparked by a rebellion in eastern Zaire. Marshal Mobutu, 66, was due to return after four months in Europe, where he has been convalescing after an operation for prostate cancer in Switzerland in August, state television announced Sunday. The governor of Kinshasa has already issued a long list of prominent civilians and soldiers convened to meet Mobutu on Tuesday afternoon at the international airport here. The head of state is due to go on to the Tshatshi military base of the elite special presidential division (DSP), whence he will broadcast an address to the nation, facing a rebellion in the east and political chaos in Kinshasa. The nature of his speech and its possible impact on the crises in Zaire were the subject of intense press speculation here on Monday. Mainly Tutsi rebels have captured a large swathe of eastern Zaire since October and stated that their eventual goal is to overthrew the Mobutu regime. Government troops have been routed from towns in North and South Kivu provinces, including the capitals, Goma and Bukavu. Kinshasa accuses Zaire's neighbours, particularly Tutsi-dominated Rwanda but also Uganda and Burundi, of ""aggression"" against Zairean territory in support of the rebels. Some analysts want the head of state, in power for more than three decades, to take the army back in hand as its supreme commander. The severe defeats it has sustained have concerned the onetime Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph-Desire Mobutu, who put down a major secessionist rebellion in what is now Shaba province, south of the current battle zone, in the 1960s, before taking power. Mobutu's supporters believe he may be able to lead a counter-offensive in the east to ""boot the enemy across the borders,"" as officials have put it, though the uprising began some 1,500 kilometres (900 miles) from Kinshasa. Under a nationalist programme, he became Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banda, which officially means: ""The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake."" On the political front, newspapers close to Mobutu's main rival in the past, Etienne Tshisekedi, are being much quieter than usual in denouncing the ""dictator"" and looking for a reconciliation between their leader and the head of state. Tshisekedi's aides argue that the only ""legal"" way out of a political impasse is for the former premier to take back the helm and form a ""national unity government."" However, the current government headed by Kengo Wa Dondo was set up according to the terms of a bumpy and oft-stalled transition to democracy and the premier was elected by the interim parliament and has the confidence of Zaire's western partners. They consider that he will be able to take the country into general elections due to be held before July next year, according to the timetable laid down by the international community. Without ruling out a possible cabinet reshuffle, foreign diplomats agree that any major political change will cause further chaos. The government would have to confront the parliament and hold consultations to get a new premier elected. In Kinshasa, this could take months and would only lead to further delays in the democratic transition, already in its seventh year. The working-class population and traders in the capital appeared to have no illusions about what the return of Mobutu will do for their own harsh living standards. ""Let's not expect manna from heaven because he's coming back,"" one journalist said, pointing out that the currency, the new zaire (NZ), was collapsing. In recent days, the exchange rate has slipped from 90,000 NZ to the US dollar to 130,000, but there has been no change in the derisory salaries and traders calculate food prices in dollars. mf-jg/nb/job AFP","""1996-12-16T00:00:00Z""","""3TDD-TH20-0031-V1GM-00000-00"""
./samples/,"CAPE TOWN, April 22 (AFP) - South Africa still believes Zairean peace talks can be held in this country, although the venue is of secondary importance, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said here Tuesday. Pahad told the parliament foreign affairs committee that rebel leader Laurent Kabila, as well as UN and Organisation of African Unity special envoy Mohammad Sahnoun, believed South Africa would be the best venue. But he added: ""As South Africans we are not really interested where the meeting is held. For us the issue is important. important. ""If it is held elsewhere and it can at least get together and work out a modus operandi for a new democratic Zaire, we will not stand in the way,"" Pahad said. ""It is our view--and the special envoy is of that opinion--that South Africa still constitutes the best venue for any successful summit to take place and we will continue to offer South African facilities,"" he said. Pahad mentioned news reports from Kinshasa quoting the son of ailing Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko--suffering from prostate cancer--as saying his father would prefer to meet Kabila in neighbouring Congo, because it is closer. He added, however, that neither he nor Sahnoun had received any official word to this effect from Mobutu. A source close to the negotiations said South Africa hoped to receive a positive response by Wednesday to the formal invitation President Nelson Mandela sent last week to Mobutu through the Zairean leader's special envoy, Honore Ngabanda Nzambo. Questioned by parliamentarians on Kabila's commitment to democracy, Pahad cited a pro-democracy communique issued after talks between the two sides in Pretoria earlier this month. ""Kabila on several occasions reiterated his commitment--he now even spells out a time--that within a year, after there is consolidation and stability in the country, there will be elections,"" Pahad said. ""He has now gone further to say (elections) 'in which all parties will participate'."" Kabila on Saturday toughened his position, saying he would meet Mobutu only to discuss the conditions of his departure, but diplomats here underplayed the importance of his statement as expected political positioning. Pahad also warned against the conflict spilling over into neighbouring countries and said Angola, Tanzania and Zambia had already been affected. ""The danger to Angola is a very real one,"" he said. ""There are reports of UNITA forces (Angolan former rebels) still in Zaire, there are reports of Katangese forces in Angola returning back to Zaire--there are constant reports of this sort, which all add to our concern about a possible explosion of that situation."" Floods of refugees have ""had a devastating effect on Tanzania--deforestation, ecological problems...a massive socio-economic problem,"" he said, adding: ""It is (causing) a similar problem in Zambia."" Speaking of US, British and Belgian forces gathering in Congo and Gabon to evacuate foreign nationals from Kinshasa if the need arises, Pahad said there were no plans at present to evacuate South Africans. ""We ourselves have not taken any such precautionary measures,"" he said. ""Our embassy is still functioning, and we are in daily contact with our embassy. There are no plans to evacuate our staff at the moment. We believe that they should remain because that is the only way we can get day to day information."" In Paris, French foreign ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt confirmed Tuesday that President Jacques Chirac's special advisor on African affairs, Michel Dupuch, had talks in Cape Town with Mandela on Monday. Dupuch had offered Mandela French support and expressed the goverment's concerns regarding Zaire and its analysis of the situation, Rummelhardt said, adding that ""what matters is that a meeting between President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila takes place quickly."" He also said Zaire had nothing to gain from further sterile clashes"" and that France wants to see a transitional government set up in Zaire leading to national reconciliation, In Washington, US State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns urged the two sides to meet and said difficulties in organizing the summit were ""quite disappointing, because...the only way that any progress is going to be made in the current civil war in Zaire"" would be through negotiations. mh/sf/nb AFP afp","""1997-04-22T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-3B30-0025-F2TV-00000-00"""

""the establishment of a government of transition should mark the start of national reconciliation. its essential task will be the implementation as rapid as possible of the indispensable electoral process,"" said french foreign ministry spokesman jacques rummelhardt. france made the appeal after michel dupuch, advisor on african affairs of president jacques chirac, met with south african president nelson mandela in the cape town last saturday on the situation in zaire. the spokesman said that the mission of dupuch is to ""expose directly to president mandela our analysis and our worries"" about the situation in zaire and to tell him france's support for his efforts to arrange a meeting between zairian president mobutu sese seko and zairian rebel leader laurent-desire kabila. ""what counts is that a meeting between president mobutu and kabila takes place as soon as possible,"" said rummelhardt. ""the will of negotiation should be expressed clearly and rapidly, which is not always the case if one judges by certain public declarations (of kabila)."" he said that ""the search for a negotiated solution is the only way out for the present crisis"" and that all other ways, including military conquest, ""will increase the sufferings of the people and worsen the humanitarian situation."" ""zaire has nothing to win in the pursuit of fruitless confrontations. to go out of this crisis, they should engage in dialogue and fix together the conditions of an orderly transition,"" said the spokesman. he also said that france does not wish to see an intervention by foreign troops into zaire to protect the foreign expatriates in the country. some 4,000 western troops, most of them americans, are now stationed in congo or near the coast of zaire, assumably for a possible evacuation operation of westerners from zaire.

""This can be a complicating factor in both Angola and Zaire peace processes,"" said George Moose, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. Moose, addressing a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Angola's new national unity government, said the former rebel army National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and Katangese members of the former government's armed forces have been publicly accused of fighting for the opposing sides in Zaire. zaire. ""Reports indicate that the Katangese have played an important military role in support of the rebel alliance,"" Moose said. Noting that ""UNITA admits that it maintains a presence in Zaire to guarantee its supply route,"" Moose said Washington has expressed ""concerns about these reports of Angolan military involvement at the highest levels of both the old and new government and of UNITA."" ""We will continue to urge restraints by all parties,"" said Moose, adding that the United States has asked Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos to support the peace initiative by Mohamed Sahnoun, joint special envoy of the United Nations and the Oragnization of African Unity for the troubled Great Lakes region. Moose said that despite international sanctions on arms sales to UNITA, the force has continued to purchase weapons from neighboring countries, ""particularly Zaire."" ""There can no longer be any excuse for this activity,"" said Moose, pointing out that UNITA was also acting as middle man in diamond sales to other countries, including Zaire. He said the formation of a government of national unity and reconciliation April 11 in the capital Luanda constituted a ""crucial stage"" but not the end of that country's peace process. Washington wants ""to encourage a meeting"" between Dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, Moose added. Savimbi, claiming security fears, did not attend the ceremonies for the new government. With his power base in southern Angola, he has not been in the capital since 1992. Underlining Washington's efforts to further the peace process in Angola, where civil war had raged since the late 1970s, Moose also noted the US four billion dollar stake in Angola's petroleum sector. Nearly seven percent of US petroleum imports come from Angola. Republican Representative Ed Royce said that ""the recent government closure of the Voice of America affiliate station in Angola and the involvement of the Angolan governement and UNITA in the Zaire civil war are issues that must be adressed if the Angolan peace process is to succeed.""

./samples/,"A face-to-face meeting between Zaire's ailing president and the rival who controls nearly three-fourths of his country has resolved little only that they plan to meet again. President Mobutu Sese Seko did not announce his resignation, as had been predicted by diplomats aboard the South African naval vessel where talks were held Sunday. Mediators fear the talks were the last chance to secure a truce and prevent the rebels from marching on Zaire's capital, Kinshasa. All indications were that the rebels intend to keep advancing. U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun told reporters that Mobutu proposed a cease-fire and a transitional government to prepare the Central African nation for its first multiparty elections. Mobutu said he would hand over power to an elected authority, though he has never ruled out running himself. But rebel leader Laurent Kabila, according to the statement read by Sahnoun, demanded that the rebels be allowed to take power as the transitional authority and that Mobutu cede power to them. Sahnoun said there was ''some tension from both sides''  at the start of Sunday's talks. ''But then there was a cordial tone, very African. There were no poisonous remarks.''  Kabila agreed to a temporary cease-fire before the meeting, according to Sahnoun, but it was not clear later whether the truce continued or that it ever had taken place. ''As a gesture of good will he has ordered his troops to stop their advance on all fronts,''  Sahnoun said, reading a statement. ''They would, however, defend themselves and reciprocate if they were attacked.''  Kabila's forces claimed Saturday to have taken control of Kenge, the last major town on the way to Kinshasa, only 185 kilometers (115 miles) to the west. Rebels also took Lisala, Mobutu's birthplace, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of the president's hometown of Gbadolite, a rebel officer said. During a news conference with a grim-faced Mobutu and smiling Kabila, Sahnoun told reporters aboard the naval ship docked in this port city that South African President Nelson Mandela, who was helping mediate the talks, would convene another meeting between the two men in six to 10 days. Mandela emphasized that Kabila has not agreed to a permanent truce. ''The question of a cease-fire is not part of his vocabulary,''  he said. ''What he is concerned with is that negotiations will lead to the end of hostilities.''  Kabila had said Friday he would go to the talks only to secure ''Mobutu's exit and the handover of power to the alliance.''  Otherwise, he said, rebel forces would take the rest of Zaire within two weeks. After the meeting, Kabila flew to Luanda, Angola. He did not comment to reporters. The Portuguese news agency LUSA said Kabila was to meet with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Zaire and Western powers have accused Angola of aiding the rebels with troops and equipment. Mobutu left the ship without addressing reporters and was expected to fly back to Kinshasa. He has insisted he never would bow to Kabila's demand to resign, but his prostate cancer and international pressure may force him to do so. Sources close to the talks had said that mediators were seeking an agreement in which Mobutu would step down for health reasons and appoint an interim president until elections could be held. This would allow Kabila and his forces to peacefully enter Kinshasa. Wearing his signature leopard-skin cap, a grim-faced Mobutu boarded the ship early Sunday. Supported by a cane in one hand and his wife Bobi Ladawa on the other, the ailing president was met by South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister Joe Modise. A White House official, responding to reports that U.S. envoy Bill Richardson was carrying a letter from Mobutu to President Bill Clinton saying that he would step down, said Saturday, ''I would not read it that way.''  Mobutu did send a letter to the United States last week in which he committed himself to negotiations with the rebels, said the ource, speaking on condition of anonymity Saturday.","""1997-05-04T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-5FY0-00BT-M428-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Rebels pressing hard to end Mobutu Sese Seko's 32-year dictatorship threaten to advance on the capital, and U.S. troops across the border in Congo are ready should evacuations be needed. The rebels have given Mobutu until Sunday to leave office and have threatened to bring their fight to Kinshasa if he doesn't. They already control more than a third of the country, mostly in the east, and have encountered little resistance in their quest to topple the president. With the prospect of civil war coming to Kinshasa, about 1,300 Marines and other U.S. forces were ""at a very high state of awareness and preparedness,"" set to evacuate hundreds of U.S. citizens if necessary, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday in Washington. ""The Marines...are standing by and at the ready in the event that they are called upon to help out,"" Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday said. There are about 500 Americans in Zaire, 320 of them in the capital. Meanwhile, an increasingly isolated Mobutu - abandoned by such longtime supporters as the United States and Belgium, its former colonial ruler - has turned to the military to salvage his long and corrosive rule. Today, France - a longtime Mobutu ally - suggested the embattled president meet with Kabila. Such a meeting would be contribute to ""facilitating a peaceful solution,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt. That is the closest France has come to suggesting Mobutu's days are numbered. Likulia Bolongo, an old army buddy of Mobutu, wore his general's uniform and was saluted by his guards Thursday as he left his luxurious Kinshasa home for his first meeting with the president since being made premier. Likulia today is expected to present 25 new Cabinet ministers for approval by Mobutu. Defense Ministry spokesman Leon Kalima said 10 posts will go to Mobutu supporters, 10 to the camp of ousted Prime Minister Leon Kengo wa Dondo, three to military officers and two to civic leaders. Kengo was Mobutu's handpicked prime minister, but he was blamed for the army's losses to eastern rebels, and Mobutu was forced to fire him two weeks ago and replace him with the popular opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi. Likulia replaces Tshisekedi, whom Mobutu cronies blocked from taking his seat as premier Wednesday. The move, coming after Mobutu had given into domestic and international pressure and appointed Tshisekedi, angered the president's overseas allies. ""Mobutuism has no future, and now we have to see how to get to a transitional government,"" Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said in Brussels. The White House called Thursday for rebel-government negotiations on a transitional government. Zairian government negotiators left South Africa today after another round of consultations with rebel delegates and U.N. officials. With Kabila's ultimatum, the talks lost any momentum gained by Tuesday's agreement to work for a cease-fire. A senior aide to Tshisekedi promised further resistance, and said the Tshisekedi administration - which considers itself Zaire's legitimate government - would seek to try Mobutu for high treason. Joseph Yaone said Tshisekedi's path would continue to be non-violent. ""We don't have to prove ourselves against barbarians."" Likulia's convoy arrived at Mobutu's heavily guarded palace, overlooking the rapids of the Zaire River, just as a bugle call marked the noon hour. The pomp recalled Mobutu's rise to power in 1965, when the United States and Belgium saw the eager and capable young colonel as the key to stabilizing Zaire and thwarting Soviet expansion in the region. The friendship faded with the end of the Cold War and Mobutu's mismanagement of Zaire's mineral-rich land. The Belgian and U.S. ambassadors met with Likulia on Thursday. ""I think that this country needs, very badly, change,"" U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson said afterward. ""What you need is responsible elected government."" The rebels said they were approaching Kinshasa and called on foreigners to evacuate the capital, according to a radio report monitored in nearby Gabon. Diplomats in Kinshasa said they were not taking the warning seriously. Doubleday said the Marines are on board the amphibious warship USS Nassau off the coast of Zaire. There also are U.S. troops in Brazzaville, Congo, across the river from Kinshasa, and in Libreville, Gabon, who would help in an airlift from the region. In the east, the United Nations today flew 200 displaced Zairians to Goma from Kisangani - where at least 40,000 Zairians displaced by advancing rebels have landed. The evacuation was a test run for an proposed airlift of tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees, who fled to Zaire in 1994 after extremists among them slaughtered at least 500,000 minority Tutsis. Though most of the Rwandan refugees have returned home, some fled deeper into Zaire's jungle.","""1997-04-11T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8N60-000Y-K0V4-00000-00"""
./samples/,"President Mobutu Sese Seko had soldiers pull the prime minister off the streets Wednesday as his reign appeared to crumble even further. And a rebel leader called a three-day halt in his army's advance to give the president a chance to abdicate. The White House, meanwhile, urged Mobutu to make way for a democratic government, calling his three-decade dictatorship ""a creature of history."" Early Thursday, rebel leader Laurent Kabila said he will halt his army's advance so Mobutu can respond to an offer to leave power and withdraw to his home village. Rebel forces had all but seized control of Lubumbashi, the country's second largest city, Kabila told a news conference. But he said his troops were meeting ""stiff resistance"" from presidential guards units in the outskirts of the city and that the airport was not yet secured. ""The sum total is that the city has fallen,"" Kabila said in Goma, a major city in eastern Zaire. The Zairian president, who had declared a nationwide state of emergency on Tuesday in response to rebel advances, named an army general as the new prime minister. Gen. Likulia Bolongo had previously served Mobutu as defense minister and army chief of staff. Likulia promised a crackdown on civil liberties, saying his primary goal was ""the restoration of public order."" The four-star general, dressed in his army uniform and surrounded by four other officers, did not elaborate on the crackdown at a news conference, but said measures would be taken against the news media if they published articles that ""affected the morale of the military."" Several foreign journalists, including an Associated Press photographer and APTV cameraman, were beaten and had their cameras stolen by soldiers during an anti-government demonstration Wednesday. The fall of Lubumbashi, the country's second largest city, is a key step in the rebel advance. They have taken control of the eastern third of Zaire in their seven-month campaign. In his news conference, Kabila said he would now pause for three days to wait for a response from Mobutu on a proposal that he leave office and withdraw. ""If in three days we will not get good news from Kinshasa on the availability of Mr. Mobutu's willingness to depart to the north, then we will be forced to continue the military advance on all the regions in which the authority remains,"" he said. Asked to elaborate, Kabila said, ""Yes, a pause. I am not saying more. I hope something major will happen within three days' time....We want him to contact us to negotiate his departure."" Direct contact? ""Yes, he can call me on the telephone."" Kabila, wearing a white shirt with a black pinstripe and black pants, met with journalists in a palace that once belonged to Mobutu. He welcomed Wednesday's White House statement urging Mobutu to make way for a transitional government. ""I think they are right by saying it now,"" he said. ""Everybody knows that this is the time for Mr. Mobutu to get out of power."" On Wednesday, the United States increased pressure on Mobutu to leave office, with White House spokesman Mike McCurry saying that U.S. officials want to see a transitional government, then elections. ""That clearly reflects our view that Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history,"" McCurry said. Last week, political parties allied against Mobutu named Etienne Tshisekedi as their choice for prime minister. Mobutu accepted his nomination in what was seen as a ploy to weaken the opposition by splitting it between Tshisekedi's supporters and those ready to join Kabila. Tshisekedi is revered in Zaire for the suffering he endured during his decades of opposition to Mobutu. Since his appointment, he had moved to undermine Mobutu by ordering parliament dissolved, annulling the constitution and offering Cabinet posts to the rebels. The opposition lawmakers who had nominated him said he had gone too far, and they joined Mobutu supporters in calling for his ouster. On Wednesday, Tshisekedi tried to lead thousands of supporters to the prime minister's office to assume control. Walking in the huge crowd with his hand raised in a victory salute, Tshisekedi confronted a row of soldiers backed by troops in armored personnel carriers. The showdown took place near a monument to peace and freedom erected in a traffic circle. Mobutu's son, Capt. Mobutu Kongulu, appeared to be leading the soldiers. Hundreds of them fired tear gas at the marchers, with one canister landing near Tshisekedi. He was hustled into an army vehicle and driven away. ""Mr. Tshisekedi was brought to his home for his own safety,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Leon Kalima said. ""He is not under house arrest."" Tshisekedi, later seen at him home conferring with aides, refused to speak to reporters. Bruno Tshibala, one of the founders of Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress, said the protests would continue. ""We are living through the last acts of a desperate administration about to fall,"" he said. The ouster of Tshisekedi and his replacement with a military general were further setbacks to Zaire's long-stalled democratic reforms. A top aide to Tshisekedi said the ousted prime minister was pleased with the White House comment. ""The U.S. administration has finally come to see that the post-Mobutu era has arrived,"" Mtumbabo Clement said. The rebels, meanwhile, said Tshisekedi's removal was insignificant to their cause. ""He never had any power anyway,"" said Mawampanga Mwana Nanga, economic minister at rebel headquarters in the eastern city of Goma. A resident of Lubumbashi, capital of the copper- and cobalt-rich Shaba region, said Wednesday that the rebels were exchanging gunfire with Zairian soldiers in the city. Thierry Mwengwe said he and other civilians in the southeastern city were in hiding. A commander at the rebels' headquarters in Goma, who identified himself as Mufu, said the rebels control Lubumbashi. The unrest throughout Zaire prompted the United Nations to begin reducing its staff in Kinshasa. U.N. spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt said 12 staff members would leave the capital within 48 hours.

./samples/,"He captured the country with barely a battle and was greeted by cheering crowds after each new conquest. Now rebel leader Laurent Kabila faces his biggest challenge: trying to balance promises of democracy with the strong leadership needed to rebuild this neglected nation and hold its more than 250 ethnic groups together. Too many wrong moves could cause the millions who urged him on to label him a dictator, and cost Kabila the international backing he needs to get foreign investment, revive Zaire's economy and prepare for any elections. The career rebel's biggest threats come from his lack of political experience and from the support he received from neighboring Uganda and Rwanda to overthrow President Mobutu Sese Seko. Upon capturing Kinshasa without a fight Saturday, Kabila promised to name a transitional government within 72 hours and to introduce a new constitution in 60 days. However, he unilaterally declared himself president and set no date for elections that residents have been denied for decades under Mobutu. Kabila would be wise to hold elections as quickly as possible, while people still look up to him for having ousted Mobutu. The longer he waits, the more he risks disenchanting international donors and losing fans among Zaire's ethnically fractious population, which is wary of Kabila's outside support and the ethnic roots of his rebellion. Most of Kabila's original fighters were Banyamulenge, Zairian-born ethnic Tutsis who took up arms after Mobutu said they were not true Zairians and tried to expel them. The ethnic makeup of Kabila's army became more diverse as he acquired new territory and recruits, but many Zairians still see it as a Tutsi-led movement - which could lead to tribal divisions in the government and military. Their concerns, and those of the international community, haven't been allayed by the rebels' attitude toward tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees in Zaire. The refugees fled Rwanda in 1994, fearing Tutsi revenge after the Hutu government in power at the time orchestrated the slaughter of at least 500,000 minority Tutsis. Kabila has been accused by the United Nations and Mobutu's regime of trying to avenge the genocide by attacking the Hutus, who had occupied refugee camps along Zaire's eastern borders but were pushed further into Zaire by rebel advances. Kabila denies the allegation and accuses the United Nations of incompetence, a sign of his general insouciance toward the international community. The rebel chief's snub of South African President Nelson Mandela - failing to show up for peace talks on Wednesday - was a striking example of that. Bill Richardson, the American ambassador to the United Nations, acknowledges that Kabila needs some ""seasoning"" in the ways of politics, and the U.S. government has admitted to being leery of Kabila. But, content to ignore Kabila's failings for the time being, investors are rushing into rebel-held mining regions to strike deals with him. It's easy to understand, given the fact that compared to Mobutu, just about anyone would look good. By driving out the Zairian leader, Kabila managed to rid Africa of a looting regime and bring some stability to the entire Central African region. Mobutu was at odds with Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda for his backing of Rwanda's former Hutu regime that organized the Tutsi genocide, and with Angola for his support of Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. Mobutu's ouster cuts off Savimbi's major supply source, giving Angola's tenuous peace a better chance of surviving. Even if the takeover of Kinshasa had erupted in bloodshed, international criticisms would probably have quickly passed in favor of encouraging Kabila's political and economic reforms. Critics accept that Kabila has been concentrating more on fighting a war than running a country. Now that he has won, Kabila can start transforming the rebel movement into a government that stands to come out on top when compared to its predecessor.

./samples/,"Zaire's rebel leader gave Zairian President President Mobutu Sese Seko an ultimatum Monday: he hands over control of the country in eight days or ''perishes with his power.''  Troops loyal to rebel chief Laurent Kabila were reportedly closing in on Kinshasa, Zaire's sprawling capital of 6 million people. Kabila said rebel troops were less than 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the city. After Sunday's first face-to-face meeting with Mobutu on a South African naval vessel, Kabila said he gave Mobutu eight days to step down. In the meantime, the rebel chief said there would be no cease-fire. ''He has to choose to relinquish power, and he is safeguarded, or, he perishes with his power,''  Kabila told reporters in English a day after his return from face-to-face talks with the ailing Zairian leader. Meanwhile, Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who was instrumental in setting up the shipboard talks, returned to Lubumbashi on Monday and held talks with Kabila after the news conference. After the one-hour meeting, Richardson said he had delivered an urgent message to the rebel leader from U.S. President Bill Clinton. ''We stressed our longstanding view that for the benefit of the Zairian people; 1) there should be a peaceful entry into the capital of Kinshasa a soft landing which avoids violence and chaos; 2) there should be an inclusive transitional government and 3) fair and open elections,''  Richardson said. He added that he had been ''very, very encouraged by Mr. Kabila's tone of conciliation today.''  Richardson was in Kigali, Rwanda, on Sunday where he met with Vice-President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame. He said he was heading for Botswana where he would meet with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. Asked why he was seeing these two, Richardson replied that they were ''big players.''  Kabila is widely believed to have been pushed up to his present visible position by Museveni, who was also Kagame's mentor when the Rwandan was a Tutsi refugee in Museveni's rebel National Resistance Movement that seized power in Uganda in 1986 after a six-year civil war. Kagame was the head of the Rwandan Patriotic Front rebel movement that overthrew the Hutu government in July 1994 after extremist Hutus carried out a massacre of at least half a million minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus. During the news conference, Kabila denied he had ever agreed to a cease-fire while the negotiating process was going on. ''Who declared a cease-fire? Absolutely not,''  he said in response to a question about a statement Sunday from U.N. envoy Mohammed Sahnoun that he had agreed to a temporary cease-fire as a ''gesture of good will''  before the meeting. ''Cease-fire is not in the language of President Kabila,''  interjected the rebel foreign affairs spokesman, Bizima Karaha. Asked what would happen if Mobutu refused the rebel timetable, Kabila said: ''He will be chased from the power, pushed out of Kinshasa in a few days.''  The 56-year-old rebel leader said he had refused to shake hands with Mobutu at the meeting because ''there is no need to shake a bloody hand.''  But he added that he felt pity for the 66-year-old man suffering from prostate cancer. ''In the state I saw him, it is a pity, so I don't dislike him now. I like him,''  Kabila said and then laughed. He said the troops of his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire now number 70,000 and are advancing on Kinshasa. In less than seven months, the rebels have seized more than three-quarters of Africa's third-largest nation. Asked whether he thought Mobutu would end up accepting the rebel conditions, Kabila said: ''It depends. If he is the only one taking the decision for himself, we shall not fight. But seven days' delay is longer than we expected. So both will apply. Maybe he will fight. Maybe he will surrender before we reach the suburbs of Kinshasa in two days.''  He said rebel troops were less than 60 kilometers (35 miles) from Kinshasa's Njili airport and less than 120 kilometers (75 iles) from other sides of the city.","""1997-05-05T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-5G20-00BT-M49C-00000-00"""
./samples/,"In its first statement acknowledging the new government in Kinshasa, the U.N. Security Council said it respects the ""legitimate aspirations"" of the people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It said those aspirations are to ""achieve progress in the political, economic and social fields to the benefit of all."" The statement was issued late Thursday, on the same day self-declared President Laurent Kabila was inaugurated in the capital, two weeks after his victorious troops took over the country. It called for respect of Congo's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference and the withdrawal of ""all external forces, including mercenaries."" The statement did not mention Kabila by name. It called on the ""president"" of the Congo to accept the holding of an international conference ""on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region."" The conference is part of a five-point peace plan issued by the council back in February when Kabila's troops were defeating Zairean government troops and taking over big cities. The plan had called for a ceasefire, peaceful settlement of the conflict through negotiations and free access by humanitarian organizations. The council said it ""respects and attaches great importance"" to Kabila's commitment to form a ""transitional government that is broadly based, and to convene a constitutional assembly within 60 days and to hold elections."" Kabila has pledged to hold presidential and legislative elections in April 1999. The council called for access by humanitarian relief workers to help refugees in Congo and for that country's cooperation in investigations on reported ""massacres, atrocities and violations of international humanitarian law."" The statement, which was originally drafted by the United States, was seen also as a move to support U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson, who has been asked by Washington to visit Kabila and urge him to abide by the democratic process after ending the 32-year dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko. dpa tn cm","""1997-05-30T00:00:00Z""","""3RPR-R0H0-0094-N4FF-00000-00"""
./samples/,"The resignation of Zaire's prime minister underscores the power struggle that is under way as the government faces an insurgency which has left much of eastern Zaire in rebel hands. State TV said Monday night that President Mobutu Sese Seko had accepted the resignation of his hand-picked prime minister, Leon Kengo wa Dondo, and Kengo's government. Lawmakers planned to meet today to lay the groundwork for a transitional government. Parliament voted to oust Kengo a week ago, accusing him of not being tough enough on the Tutsi-backed rebels who have captured nearly a third of the mineral-rich central African nation. Kengo's mother is a Rwandan Tutsi. ""We've always been ready to do anything that would lead to a resolution of the Zairian crisis,"" said Zola Kinkela, secretary-general of Kengo's political party, the Union of Independent Democrats. Mobutu, 66 and ailing with prostate cancer, called on Kengo to do what he could to allow the seating of a new government. Supporters of Etienne Tshisekedi, a popular opposition leader and longtime Mobutu foe, say he should take over as prime minister and begin talks with the rebels. Parliament elected Tshisekedi prime minister in 1992 but Mobutu refused to confirm him and instead backed Kengo for the job. Tshisekedi has pledged to negotiate with rebel leader Laurent Kabila, form a coalition government and prepare the country for its first multiparty elections. Mobutu, who has ruled Zaire for 31 years, is one of the world's richest men, while ordinary Zairians struggle in poverty. Two rebels left the northern city of Kisangani to attend a special summit of the Organization of African Unity in Lome, Togo, on Wednesday. Bizimana Karaha, Kabila's foreign affairs adviser, told reporters he received a special invitation to attend the meeting from Togo's president. Karaha said he may meet with Zairian government representatives at the gathering. An estimated 20 heads of state of the 53-member OAU are expected. In Brazzaville, Congo, just across the river from the Zairian capital of Kinshasa, troops from the United States, France and Belgium were preparing for the possible evacuation of foreigners in case Kinshasa erupts into violence. The Congolese government, which fears an influx of Zairian refugees if the situation deteriorates, has welcomed the troops, which include 260 Americans. Though the rebels are still far from Kinshasa, many fear a rampage by Zaire's soldiers if Mobutu dies or the rebels continue their advance. There are about 320 Americans in Kinshasa, as well as some 7,000 Europeans. The USS Nassau, with 1,000 Marines, is also heading to a position off the African coast to assist in any evacuation. Washington has made it clear, however, that it has no intention of doing anything beyond getting Americans out.","""1997-03-25T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8VS0-000Y-K1F7-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Rebel leader Laurent Kabila objected Sunday to the presence of American troops on Zaire's border, calling them a threat to his country's integrity. ""They could move in at any time. They don't recognize the sovereignty of our people,"" Kabila said at rebel headquarters in eastern Zaire. ""For us it is a threat to our territorial integrity,"" said Kabila, whose forces have taken control of the eastern third of Zaire during their seven-month campaign to oust dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila also said there should be no international intervention in Zaire. About 1,200 U.S., Belgian, French and British soldiers forces have set up camp in Brazzaville, Congo, across the Zaire River from the Zairian capital of Kinshasa, in case Westerners have to be evacuated. The U.S. warship Nassau is also stationed off the coast of the central African nation, with about 1,000 Marines aboard. While Kabila didn't say specifically that American troops should leave the region, he apparently fears there are more U.S. soldiers than would be needed to evacuate the 500 or so Americans who live in Zaire. State Department officials in Washington refused to comment Sunday on Kabila's objections, but reiterated that the possible evacuation is the soldiers' sole purpose. The rebels have kept up their advance through Zaire, although their representatives are meeting in South Africa with officials from Mobutu's government, trying to sort out a peaceful resolution to the crisis. South African and Zairian officials were tight-lipped Sunday about progress in the first substantive peace negotiations between Zaire's warring factions. No one involved would say where the talks were being held or even characterize the tone of the discussions. The two sides met informally Saturday because they were still waiting for some government representatives to fly in. The rebels, who began the talks sounding like they were in no mood to compromise, appeared slightly more conciliatory on Sunday. Despite earlier threats to withdraw from the talks if they did not begin on schedule Saturday, the rebel's representative in South Africa, Richard Wenu, told The Associated Press: ""We are prepared to wait however long it takes for a compromise."" Rebel forces are reported nearing Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city and the capital of the mineral-rich Shaba region. Mining industry sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that a vanguard group of rebels had reached the city, though it was unclear whether there was any fighting. Kabila confirmed Sunday that the rebels had taken Mbuji-Mayi, the country's diamond-mining center, 435 miles northwest of Lubumbashi, encountering some opposition from Mobutu's forces. The diamonds, and Shaba's copper and cobalt, have been a money-making machine for Mobutu's 31-year regime. Now, they will be revenue for the alliance. Kabila said officials of the South-African-based Anglo American Corporation - the firm that owns the diamond mines - were in Goma on Saturday to renegotiate contracts. Speaking Sunday of his plans for the future of Zaire, Kabila said he envisions a transitional government, a political reorganization, then elections within a year. Last month, Kabila said only his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire would be allowed to function as a political party. But on Sunday, he said other parties would be allowed to return to the political arena, possibly including Mobutu's Popular Revolutionary Movement party. He insisted once again that the rebels would not share power with ""Mobutists."" ""The aim of the negotiations is for Mobutu to relinquish power. Power-sharing is not an issue."" The rebels, who control the important river city of Kisangani in central Zaire, agreed Saturday to allow international aid agencies to airlift Rwandan Hutu refugees from camps south of the city. Relief agencies say about 120 of the estimated 100,000 refugees there are dying each day from malnutrition, disease and exhaustion. The airlift probably will begin by the end of this week, the U.N. refugee agency said Sunday. It will take that long to organize the highly-complex transportation and select the refugees most in need of moving but still able to survive the trip, said Pam O'Toole, chief spokeswoman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. Before reaching the two areas south of Kisangani where they are now concentrated, the refugees had traveled through the rain forests of eastern Zaire for more than five months. They were driven into the interior by militant Hutus running from the Zairian rebels they were fighting. Among them, the rebels say, are some of the hard-core Hutus responsible for the massacre. The Hutu refugees left their homeland in 1994 to escape possible retribution for the slaughter of a half-million minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.","""1997-04-06T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8PW0-000Y-K451-00000-00"""

""It was a collective decision taken by the different governments today. It will allow for more thorough preparation for the next summit,"" Mandela's media spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, said. Mankahlana said a delegation of foreign ministers would meet in Kinshasa soon to set another date for the summit which is to discuss the fighting in eastern Zaire between ethnic Tutsis and the Zairean army.

Mandela remains committed to the spirit of the summit and hopes an alternative date could be set speedily, Mankahlana said. Mankahlana said that Mandela will instead, on Monday, meet with Angolan opposition leader Jonas Savimbi at the president's home in Qunu on South Africa's east coast to discuss the establishment of a national unity government in Angola, SAPA news agency said.

./samples/,"An African summit on the crisis in Zaire opens Wednesday in Togo's capital Lome, with rebels rejecting a recent offer by Zaire's embattled government to join a power-sharing deal. Over 15 African heads of state and other representatives are attending the summit held by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to try and pursuade the warring sides in Zaire to work out a peaceful solution. Neither Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko nor rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila will personally attend the summit, though each has sent a representative. Mobutu's ruling party late Tuesday offered to share power with the rebels, who have now seized about 25 per cent of Zaire in the east. It said a transitional government could be formed which would prepare the country for eventual elections. But the rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) have adamantly rejected such a plan. They say Mobutu's fraying government is corrupt, and that the rebels have been fighting for freedom, democracy and a united country, not for ""power sharing"" with a regime they view as rotten. ""We shall never, never enter into any power sharing with the government in Kinshasa,"" rebel foreign policy adviser Bizima Karaha, in Lome for the summit, told British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio Wednesday. ""One thing is for sure, we won't let them continue with those games,"" he added. African foreign ministers have drawn up a draft resolution on the Zairean crisis which will be presented Wednesday. Diplomats say it is similar to the U.N.'s five-point peace plan, but that it solves the rebel-government controversy over which comes first - talks or a truce? - by calling for negotiations and a ceasefire at the same time. Mobutu's spokesman says the ailing president wants to appoint a seven-member negotiating team to begin talks with Kabila's rebels. He told Zaire's state television that Mobutu would also create a national council to advise on the transition to democracy. But some analysts say Kabila can virtually run the show, since he is in a position of strength. His forces have now come within 100 kilometers of Lubumbashi, Zaire's second largest city and the capital of mineral-rich Shaba province. It will be a struggle for the African heads of state to convince Kabila that it would be in his best interests to halt his successful sweep across Zaire and negotiate with the weakened government.

""I said with more assurance than I felt that it wouldn't,"" Tatro said Monday. ""It leaves everyone with a sense of insecurity about whether to go to the mall or whether to go out to a walk in a crowded place."" Tatro spoke of the fear of bombings he and his family must endure every day in Jerusalem as part of a panel discussion at the AP's annual meeting. The discussion with AP reporters from around the world was moderated by Louis D. Boccardi, AP president and chief executive officer. Earlier in the day, retiring chairman Frank Daniels Jr. bid farewell to member publishers and editors of the news cooperative, ending a five-year term that saw AP innovations in digital photography, advertising technology and online service. Also at the meeting, election results from all-mail voting showed that John W. Madigan, chairman, president and chief executive officer of the Tribune Co., and Lissa Walls Vahldiek, vice president and chief operating officer of Southern Newspapers Inc., won seats on the AP's board of directors. Five incumbents were re-elected: John J. Curley, chairman, president and CEO of Gannett Co., representing The News Journal of Wilmington, Del.; Donald E. Newhouse, president of The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J.; Mary Schurz, editor and publisher of The Advocate-Messenger of Danville, Ky.; George W. Wilson, president of the Concord (N.H.) Monitor; and, representing a city under 50,000 population, Gregg K. Jones, co-publisher of The Greeneville (Tenn.) Sun. The AP meeting and luncheon were attended by executives representing AP's 1,544 daily newspapers. They were the opening events of the first full day of activities of the Newspaper Association of America's convention. In a luncheon speech, White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles said he tried to help find work for fallen presidential friend Webster Hubbell because he was taught as a child to help people in trouble. Bowles said he decided to try to help when U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor called him and told him of Hubbell's plight. Heeding his father's advice to lend a hand to friends in need, Bowles said he called three businessmen on Hubbell's behalf. ""They were all old friends of mine,"" Bowles said, adding that Hubbell did not find a job as a result of those calls. Daniels, who has been a member of the AP board of directors since 1983 and chairman since 1992, retired earlier this year as president and publisher of the News & Observer of Raleigh, N.C. ""I believe that AP is in the forefront of innovation - assisting our members without in any way conflicting with them,"" he said. ""Next year we're going to be celebrating our 150 years of existence, and in my judgment, The Associated Press continues to grow and improve each year."" Boccardi paid tribute to Daniels, saying, ""He is really a remarkable man and I have learned immensely from him - about business, about the news business, and about human nature. ""He's cheered our successes and encouraged us to try again when we failed,"" Boccardi said. Boccardi and Newhouse, the chairman-elect, pointed to the success of AP developments such as an online photo archive; AP StocksExpress, a paginated stock service for smaller newspapers; and AdSEND, a digital advertising delivery service. Boccardi also offered a live demonstration of The WIRE, AP's online service for members, which made its debut in October 1996. The panel discussion included Nairobi-based newswoman Karin Davies, AP vice president and special correspondent Walter R. Mears, Washington, D.C., special assignment editor John Solomon and White House reporter Sonya Ross. Davies told the emotionally gripping story of being held last Halloween along with a photographer by government forces in Zaire and told to ""live your last moments. You're going to die."" They were freed hours later. She prompted a round of laughter with her story about deciding not to tell her mother that she was covering war-torn Africa. The truth came out after her photographer was wounded and a photo of her cradling the bloody man was printed in her hometown paper, The Seattle Times. A friend called her mother to say her daughter, at the time a London-based reporter, was in the paper. ""And my mother said, 'Oh, at Wimbledon?""' Davis explained. Mears, who has traveled with seven presidents, said press access to the president has narrowed steadily over the years, thanks to an ""on-guard sense"" from politicians that comes from every word and action being recorded and dissected for public consumption. Ross said first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is far more accessible on trips than her husband. ""She comes back to the press quarters of the plane to commiserate over the day, to talk about some things that she may have on her mind, to see pictures that photographers took on the laptop,"" she said. ""He is on a larger plane; it's more difficult for him to come back."" Solomon noted that the White House has been unusually vigorous in turning over newsmaking documents related to the controversy over Democratic political fund-raising tactics. The strategy appears to be to release the documents before Republicans uncover them and to inundate Americans with so much information that they become less interested in the controversy, Solomon said. In the board election, Madigan, representing the Chicago Tribune, succeeds Robert H. Hartmann, chairman and publisher of the Evansville (Ind.) Press, who did not seek re-election.

./samples/,"LUBUMBASHI, Zaire, April 8 (AFP) - Zaire's second city Lubumbashi was waiting Tuesday for its conquest by rebels who now control the mineral-rich eastern third of the country. Mortar fire was heard Monday night coming from the direction of the airport, 10 kilometers (six miles) to the north. Earlier Monday, government troops in the southeastern city--a major center for cobalt and copper mining--showed white flags of surrender. Some passed over to the rebel side. Only the elite Presidential Security Division showed signs of resisting the rebels, who late Monday were reported to be no more than 15 kilometers (10 miles) out of the city. city. Streets were empty Monday as residents awaited the fall of the city, which many locals have been expecting for some weeks now. Led by Laurent-Desire Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, the mainly Tutsi rebels have the long-range goal of deposing President Mobutu Sese Seko. The capture of Lubumbashi, not far from the Zambian border, would be their biggest victory in an offensive that began last October and met little resistance from government forces. Kabila himself arrived Monday in Mbuji-Mayi, the diamond capital of Zaire which fell to his rebels four days ago. Some 2,000 people lined the streets to welcome Kabila, who flew in aboard his private jet, chanting ""oust him, oust him,"" a reference to Mobutu. Kabila flew in from his stronghold in Goma, eastern Zaire, where he held talks at the weekend with South African diamond giant De Beers to discuss its operations in Zaire. In South Africa, ""informal discussions"" continued at a secret location near Pretoria between envoys representing Mobutu and Kabila, the foreign ministry there said. The talks began last Saturday and little word has emerged as to their progress. But Thami Ntenteni, spokesman for South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, said: ""I think we can remain optimistic."" One diplomat in South Africa suggested privately that a rebel conquest of Lubumbashi could speed up the talks, with Kabila possibly ""willing to consider a ceasefire"" afterwards. That in turn could lead to a meeting between the rebel leader and the dictatorial president who has run Zaire for more than 30 years with support from Western powers. In Washington, the State Department declared that the United States would not get involved in the conflict. ""The United States has no intention--zero--of intervening militarily in Zaire to affect the course of the fighting,"" its spokesman Nicholas Burns said. ""We support the territorial integrity of Zaire."" In Kinshasa, political turmoil continued as parliament, under pressure from demonstrators, cancelled a meeting called to sack the prime ministers who was appointed just last week. Troops and police ringed the parliament building and used tear gas and baton charges to prevent supporters of Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi protesting outside a meeting of the parliament. MPs were due to discuss a motion removing Tshisekedi from office after he threatened to dissolve the parliament last Friday, but the session was abandoned. An armoured vehicle was deployed along the road leading to the parliament building to deter a repeat of earlier scenes when students and Tshisekedi supporters marched on parliament, seizing private vehicles and attacking passengers they believed to be MPs heading to the debate. burs/rom AFP (ADDS peace talks break up, Kabila says Kinshasa is next target. Picture. Graphic.) By Jean-Pierre Campagne LUBUMBASHI, Zaire, April 8 (AFP) - Zairean troops fought Tuesday to contain rebels closing on Lubumbashi as peace talks in South Africa between government and rebel officials broke up with no quick fix in prospect. The country's second city and economic powerhouse is virtually surrounded by the rebels, but government soldiers appeared prepared to put up a stiffer resistance than they have done so far in the six-month civil war. Rebel leader Laurent Kabila, speaking to crowds in Zaire's diamond capital Mbuji-Mayi just three days after it was taken, insisted Kinshasa was his next target after, as expected, his forces seize Lubumbashi. Informed sources said the guerrillas were 10 kilometres (six miles) south of the city, while sporadic mortar fire could be heard to the west and south, probably from government positions. According to reports, there were fire-fights to the west and Zairean troops had taken ""seven dead or wounded"" to one of their barracks. Unconfirmed reports suggested government soldiers had launched an attack on Mount Simba, 15 kilometres (10 miles) to the west, dislodging rebel forces who took up positions elsewhere. The army was said to be attempting to recapture Kipushi, 30 kilometres to the west, which fell to the rebels without a fight early Monday. Their resistance is tougher than expected, after some troops passed to the rebels Monday, others waved white flags and junior officers urged soldiers to lay down their arms. Rebel troops did not appear to have any heavy weapons of their own around Lubumbashi but a resident in Kipushi, contacted by telephone, said they were dispatching some to the area from that town. In Mbuji-Mayi, Kabila claimed his most advanced forces were already in the provinces of Bandundu and Equateur, the former next to Kinshasa itself. ""We're advancing, we're heading for Kinshasa. That is our objective, the political capital. We are certain we'll be there with you."" He told his supporters massed in the town's stadium that President Mobutu Sese Seko was to blame for all the country's woes, and appealed to new Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi ""to leave the Mobutu camp."" In Pretoria, representatives of the two warring sides adjourned their peace talks with agreement on the need for a ceasefire, but no quick fix. ""Both parties agree on negotiations to bring about a peaceful political solution to the conflict,"" they said in a joint statement released by South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. ""This necessitates a complete cessation of hositilites and measures consistent with the UN/Organisation of African Unity peace plan."" Mbeki said the delegations had agreed on ""five points of convergence"" and had adjourned the talks until further notice to consult their leaders. Usually in this six-month civil war, the rebels have taken town after town with barely a fight and people in Lubumbashi have been expecting them to walk in for more than two weeks now. ""It's quiet right now, but let's get it over with. We've been waiting for Kabila for weeks,"" one resident said. Kabila, speaking in Mbuji-Mayi, said he had turned down an offer by South African mediators on the creation of a transitional government, saying Mobutu had to go first. Tshisekedi's place, he said, was ""not with Mobutu but against Mobutu."" To the cheers of the crowd, he went on: ""We are all in the same trench against a single enemy."" In Geneva meanwhile, a report to the UN Commission on Human Rights quoted witnesses of around 40 massacres attributed to rebel forces in eastern Zaire since they began their offensive in October. ""Although the information is frequently inadequate and even contradictory, as a rule the acts denounced actually occurred,"" says the report, drawn up by special rapporteur Roberto Garreton who briefly visited Zaire last month. He and the rapporteurs for Burundi and Rwanda called for an international peace conference for the Great Lakes region, saying world opinion appeared to be waiting for a ""mega-catastrophe."" jpc/km/job AFP afp","""1997-04-08T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-3DV0-0025-F4NC-00000-00"""
./samples/,"From Reuters-AP KISANGANI, Zaire (CP) - Rebel leader Laurent Kabila has outlined his plans for a transitional government in Zaire. Kabila said Saturday he would refuse to work with any political leader who has co-operated with ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko. ""We say that the ADFL transitional government should be made of ADFL members and only anti-Mobutists and anti-regime people who have never been in power and who never shared power,''  he told a news conference in Kisangani, Zaire's third city. Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire captured Kisangani about a week ago. A transitional phase, he said, would not last more than a year. Earlier, Kabila firmly told UN representative Mohamed Sahnoun that there would be no ceasefire with the government before negotiations, rejecting a plan floated by Mobutu before he returned to Zaire on Friday. Kabila said he did not see himself as a future president. ""I am the symbol of the resistance of my people against the foreign domination of this country,''  Kabila said. ""I am not the liberator. I participated in the rebellion, but I don't want to be president. I want my people to be free and then I will return to my private life.''  Sahnoun flew out of Kisangani late Saturday after brief talks with Kabila. Rebel fighters have seized about a fifth of Zaire since the start of their campaign to overthrow Mobutu last October. Mobutu, who seized power in 1965, returned to Zaire Friday to shore up his political position in the face of the virtual collapse of his army. He has spent most of his time in Europe since August and has had prostate cancer surgery there. He came out of hospital in Monaco on Wednesday. Mobutu, 66, stayed out of the public eye Saturday, although state television reported that he would resume his normal duties. Speculation deepened, however, over his health and ability to run the country. ""He can't even stand on his own,''  one opposition newspaper headline said. The United States and Belgium, meanwhile, sent or prepared to send troops to countries neighboring Zaire in anticipation of any need to evacuate their nationals. France has already sent troops to Congo and Gabon for the same reason.","""1997-03-22T00:00:00Z""","""475J-W740-01KD-R4GJ-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Zaireans counted the cost Monday of a momentous weekend in which their country changed hands, and tried to return to normal as rebel forces consolidated their hold on the capital. The city awoke in calm after a quiet night and quickly took on its usual buzz of activity. Only a few hardy street vendors had tried to sell cigarettes and sweets in the heated weekend hours, but early Monday it was back to business as usual as they fought for space. Traffic returned to the streets, taxi drivers turned up for work desperate to make up for the lost weekend, and bars and some shops were open again. again. People from outlying districts returned to work in the centre of Kinshasa on buses that have begun to function again. The central market was bustling, not at its usual frenetic rate yet but nevertheless lively. Money-changers were back in action too, taking advantage of the events to reduce the rate of the dollar to the local currency, the zaire, from 170,000 last week to 60,000. Alain Didier, a money-changer positioned near the looted Select supermarket just off the main boulevard here, said no one had many zaires left. Those who had large amounts had fled the country, he explained. ""When there are no zaires the rate changes, that's all. It will go down further."" The main port, where ferries serve Brazzaville in neighbouring Congo, was not yet functioning, but an official there said it may open later in the day. After the turbulence and looting of the weekend, residents in Kinshasa said they were happy that the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko was finally over after 32 years. They were also relieved that the capital's capture was achieved with relatively little bloodshed, although the toll was already in the hundreds. Zairean Red Cross officials said they had recovered at least 200 bodies of people killed over the weekend, mostly soldiers. Many were killed by stray bullets from gunfire that the capital all day Saturday and into early Sunday. Others were looters killed by rebels, according to local people. A few, according to some residents, also died as old scores were settled in their communities. Aid workers expect the provisional toll of 200 to rise sharply, as it was issued late Sunday afternoon before they had managed to reach many parts of the city. ""We are glad that Kabila has chased Mobutu out,"" said one man in broken English. He was eager to test his English now that the rebel forces had arrived. ""He has done one thing, and that is good, but now Kabila must do more. This was a rich country, but Mobutu stole from all of us. ""Kabila must restart the economy and then everything will happen after that."" Rebel troops were everywhere in Kinshasa, positioned at key points such as the port, barracks and camps as well as patrolling the streets. They have begun organising night patrols too to deter looters. On Sunday, the last soldiers of the elite special presidential division surrendered at Camp Tshatshi, most swearing allegiance to Kabila's rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire. Their surrender highlighted the relatively peaceful transfer of power here in the newly-renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, its name in 1965 when Mobutu took power. The alliance troops, many appearing to be only just into their teens, were greeted enthusiastically by the crowds as they marched virtually unopposed into the city centre Saturday. Even Monday, one lone soldier drew applause from residents just for crossing the road. Only one fear appeared to cloud the horizon, and that was over whether one dictatorship had been replaced by another. Kabila promised Saturday, as he declared himself president, to form a transitional government by Tuesday and call a constituent assembly within 60 days. ""We needed someone to get rid of Mobutu, but if he (Kabila) is another dictator, he will never be able to install himself in this city,"" warned Andre, a student. km/dw dw","""1997-05-19T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-34T0-0025-F4F6-00000-00"""
./samples/,"As the question of whether President Mobutu Sese Seko would return lingered in the capital Thursday, diplomats pressed on with efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement between the ailing dictator and rebel chief Laurent Kabila. ''The next few days are critical for peace in Zaire,''  said U.S. envoy Bill Richardson, in Paris to brief French diplomats after his nine-day round of shuttle diplomacy, which included several meetings with Mobutu and Kabila. Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, refused to say whether Mobutu would go into exile, though he all but acknowledged the dictator's nearly 32-year reign was coming to an end. ''The ultimate solution will involve a transitional government _ there's going to be a change in Zaire,''  Richardson told a news conference. Zaire's information minister, Kin-Kiey Mulumba, dismissed speculation that Mobutu had used a sudden trip to Gabon on Wednesday to launch his exile. He threatened to expel foreign media who had suggested as much in their reports. But Western diplomats and military observers said some high-ranking Zairian military officers close to Mobutu had already left the country or sent their families out, apparently fearing Mobutu's imminent fall. The latest to leave was Gen. Kpama Baramoto, former army chief of staff, according to officials speaking on condition of anonymity. Another general, Etienne Nzimbi Ngbale, who commands Mobutu's presidential guard, has sent his family out of Zaire, they said. Mobutu Thursday met with his regional allies in Libreville, including Gabonese President Omar Bongo, Pascal Lissouba of Congo, Idriss Deby of Chad and Ange-Felix Patasse of Central African Republic. About 190 kilometers (115 miles) east of the capital, meanwhile, reports were filtering in of fighting around the city of Kenge. There was no independent confirmation of a claim Wednesday by aid agencies that 300 people may have been killed. The Red Cross said 10 of its local workers in Kenge were among the dead. The rebels acknowledged Wednesday they were facing stiff resistance from loyalist troops in Kenge, which has an airport and could provide a good staging ground from which to fly troops into Kinshasa to secure the international airport. The government insists it remains in control of the area and denies rebel allegations it has called on mercenaries from Angola's former rebel movement to assist Mobutu, who backed the guerrillas during Angola's 20-year civil war. Both Kabila and Mobutu have been known to use foreign forces in their seven-month standoff--Kabila receiving help from Uganda and Rwanda, and Mobutu using mercenaries from eastern Europe who were stationed in Kisangani before that eastern stronghold fell to Kabila. Speculation of Angolan involvement was fueled by an incident Wednesday at Kinshasa's Ndjili airport in which government soldiers fired on a plane that was approaching and did not identify itself, military and airport sources said Thursday. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the unidentified plane landed without being hit and unloaded dozens of Portuguese-speaking passengers. Angolans, once ruled by Portugal, speak Portuguese. South Africa, which hosted Mobutu and Kabila's first face-to-face meeting Sunday on a South African ship off the Congolese coast, was working on setting up another round of talks next Wednesday, despite speculation the rebels would be in control of Kinshasa by then. Speculation that Mobutu would not return to Kinshasa had been ''largely exaggerated,''  said South African government spokesman Parks Mankahlana. Diplomats in the capital, however, have expressed doubts the two men will meet again following their first encounter, which provided no breakthroughs toward a peaceful settlement. At this stage, they say, the best hope is to clear the way for a calm transfer of power in which Mobutu, 66 and ill with prostate cancer, resigns for health reasons and Kabila takes over as head of a transitional authority until elections can be held. Kabila, they note, would be forced to call elections early or face a withholding of badly needed Western aid. In addition, he would be wise to stand for elections quickly while riding on the wave of popularity he currently enjoys for what appears to be the end of Mobutu's reign. The rebel chief would also need to satisfy the demands of Zaire's people, who have made clear they won't be happy trading one dictator for another. ''People say Mr. Kabila is the savior, that he can change everything, but that's not true,''  said Honore Masudi, who fled fighting in the North Kivu region several months ago and was waiting for food being handed out to displaced Zairians at a church in the capital Thursday. ''We have to wake up. The only way for this country to develop is to hold elections.''  Unlike most people on the streets of Kinshasa, who relish the idea of Kabila marching into the capital and driving out Mobutu, most of those at the food distribution site said they had seen the effects of the war and didn't want to go through it again. Instead, they said Mobutu should return home and work out a deal with Kabila to stop his rebels and hold presidential elections. ''People have lost families, they've lost everything they own, and if the rebels force their way in, there will be shooting and civilians will die,''  said Sophie Supa, who had also fled North Kivu. ''Me, I don't support anyone to be president, but I'd rather have Mobutu stay on and see peaceful negotiations and elections than have Kabila fight him.''

./samples/,"Rwanda Monday prepared for two days of festivities marking the anniversary of the takeover of Kigali by the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) after three months of genocidal war in the country. Monday and Tuesday have been declared holidays and big celebrations are planned in the city's Amahoro stadium to mark the July 4 anniversary Tuesday. The authorities are also planning to commemorate the end of the slaughter in which at least 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were butchered by extremist Hutus, as well as the installation of a national unity government last July 19. The war in Rwanda was unleashed after its Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed when his plane crashed as it was about to land at Kigali on April 6, 1994. The next day, a contingent of the-then rebel RPF--in Kigali under 1993 peace accords signed in the Tanzanian town of Arusha which provided for a power-sharing transitional government--launched a counter-attack against the Hutu-dominated armed forces and ""Interahamwe"" militia who had gone on a frenzied killing spree. RPF forces left their stronghold in the north of the country to come to the aid of their colleagues in the capital and the rebel advance continued progressively until Kigali was finally taken on July 4. The Tutsi-led takeover of power in a country dominated for years by the majority Hutu community provoked a massive exodus of frightened Hutus. Over one million refugees are still languishing in camps in eastern Zaire. Only southwest Rwanda remained out of the RPF's grasp after France set up a ""safe haven"" for refugees as part of its Operation Turquoise, although it was widely believed Hutu extremists were regrouping in the area. The safe haven finally melted away after the French, whose presence was always contentious for the RPF, left the country and Rwandan Patriotic Army troops went into the camps to search for extremists. In May, one such incursion resulted in the deaths of hundreds of refugees at the Kibeho refugee camp. mgu-at/ca/js AFP","""1995-07-03T00:00:00Z""","""3TDD-WY70-0031-V09V-00000-00"""

Amid reports President Mobutu Sese Seko was preparing to leave for neighboring Gabon or possibly France, the State Department said his government should urgently negotiate with the rebels to ""ensure a peaceful transfer of power"" and arrange an interim government. Department spokesman John Dinger credited rebel leader Laurent Kabila with expressing interest in both democracy and the free market and said the transfer of power ""should be peaceful."" The spokesman again urged the approximately 400 U.S. citizens in Zaire to leave. Most are in the capital Kinshasa, where Dinger said the situation remains calm so far. ""It becomes increasingly apparent the rebel forces will move into the capital,"" Dinger said. He cited reports they were 50 to 150 miles from the city. American envoy Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, met Tuesday in Botswana with the presidents of Uganda, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. He then went to Cape Town, South Africa, for more meetings. Richardson is due Wednesday in Paris to brief French officials. France has long considered Central Africa an area of special French expertise, based partly on long colonial control of countries there and a common language. Mobutu, 66, has a villa on the French Riviera and may be considering exile in France, which for decades helped to prop him up. As his country fell apart, Mobutu spent months in France after treatment for prostate cancer. Mobutu also had American backing for much of the Cold War. Successive U.S. administrations considered him a bulwark against communism and provided with financial aid, helping him build a personal fortune believed to be enormous. Kabila's 70,000 troops have captured three-fourths of Zaire in seven months and vowed Monday to storm Kinshasa within days unless Mobutu resigns immediately. On Tuesday, Kabila sent contrary signals about his intentions to take the capital. ""It is increasingly apparent that President Mobutu or his representatives need to urgently conduct negotiations with the rebel alliance,"" Dinger said. ""The goal of those negotiations should be to...ensure a peaceful transfer of power, that it should result in an inclusive transitional government, that the transitional government should lead as soon as possible to elections, and that in those elections the people of Zaire should be able to choose the people who govern them.""","""1997-05-06T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8B60-000Y-K01C-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Secrecy surrounded preparations for Zairian peace talks, with officials refusing to confirm today whether a rebel delegation had joined the government's chief negotiator in South Africa. The U.N. resident coordinator in South Africa, David Whaley, said the talks were likely to begin Saturday or Sunday but the location would remain secret to avoid the media. U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun hopes to get the two sides to agree to a cease-fire, but there was no confirmation that they would even meet face to face. The goal could be simply to guarantee further talks. President Mobutu Sese Seko previously has demanded a cease-fire before peace talks, while rebel leader Laurent Kabila has insisted on talks first. Now, it appears both sides are willing to consider a cease-fire that would take place simultaneously with peace talks. But it was unclear whether the initial discussions here would halt the rebel advance. Kabila's troops control about a third of the country after a six-month offensive that has met little resistance. They aim to topple Mobutu's 31-year-old dictatorship. Honore Ngbanda, who represented Mobutu at earlier talks in South Africa, flew in Thursday afternoon, then met briefly with Sahnoun, Zaire Embassy Charge d'Affaires Issa Ganda said today. Ngbanda was accompanied by just a few members of his delegation, which likely will total at least seven. The rest were expected to arrive today, including members of Zairian opposition parties. The inclusion of opposition parties in the government negotiating team indicated Mobutu was trying to make the talks a broad forum on Zaire's conflict instead of a showdown between his teetering regime and the rebels. But growing conflict between Mobutu's supporters and opposition parties could be ""a complicating factor,"" the U.N.'s Whaley said. Mobutu, 66 and ailing with prostate cancer, no longer exercises absolute control. Newly appointed Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, in his first day in office Thursday, annulled the constitution and dissolved the 740-member Parliament to establish a transitional government and prepare for the first multi-party elections since Mobutu seized power in 1965. He did not set a date. For the rebels, a two-member delegation led by Bizima Karaha left Goma, Zaire, on Thursday and had been expected to arrive that night at a military base outside Johannesburg. But South African and U.N. officials refused to confirm today whether they were here. Karaha is Kabila's foreign policy adviser and represented the rebels at last week's Organization of African Unity summit in Lome, Togo. South Africa has a stake in successful peace talks for nearby Zaire. It seeks to establish a firm African role in solving problems on the continent and already has seen a spillover of Zaire's strife into neighboring countries.

Still, he is clinging to his presidency and angrily rejects suggestions he would not return to Zaire. Mobutu made the pledge in a statement Thursday he and five other African leaders issued from neighboring Gabon. The editor of the government-run daily newspaper L'Union, Ngoyo Moussavou, said Thursday that the Zairian president planned to return to his country Friday morning. Moussavou said the flight would leave Gabon at 10 a.m. (0900 GMT). There was no confirmation from the Zairian government. Western diplomats, meanwhile, pushed for a peace settlement between Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent Kabila.

''The ultimate solution will involve a transitional government _ there's going to be a change in Zaire,''  Richardson said. In a statement, the leaders of five regional Zairian allies called on the Zairian Armed Forces to prepare for the ballot and said Mobutu, who has prostate cancer, was too ill to run in the elections. The heads of state the presidents of Gabon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Chad and the foreign minister of Cameroon kept Mobutu waiting in the guest room of the presidential palace while they prepared the joint statement. At the news conference, the document was read aloud and Mobutu nodded and signed it along with the other representatives. The statement made no mention of Mobutu resigning or giving power to a transitional authority that would include Kabila, as the rebel chief has demanded. Since promising a transition to democracy in 1990, Mobutu has repeatedly postponed the country's first multiparty elections. But with mounting international pressure and the rebels closing in on the capital, he has in recent weeks repeated his promise. After his first face-to-face talks with Kabila on Sunday, he called for a transitional authority to prepare for elections. But his announcement Thursday was the first time that Mobutu conceded that he was too ill to run for office. While Western diplomats and military observers have suggested that Mobutu scheduled the Gabon trip as a convenient way to leave the country permanently, the Zairian president has steadfastly denied that. Asked during Thursday's news conference whether he planned to return home, Mobutu replied angrily, ''Why not?''  Zaire's information minister, Kin-Kiey Mulumba, also dismissed the speculation and threatened to expel foreign media who had suggested as much. But the diplomats and military observers said some high-ranking Zairian military officers close to Mobutu had already left the country or sent their families out, apparently fearing Mobutu's imminent fall.

There was no independent verification of the claim. The Red Cross said 10 of its local workers in Kenge were among the dead. The rebels acknowledged Wednesday they were facing stiff resistance from government soldiers in Kenge, whose airport could serve as a staging ground for flying troops into Kinshasa to secure the international airport. The government insists it remains in control of the area and denies rebel allegations that mercenaries from Angola's former rebel movement are assisting Mobutu, who backed the guerrillas during Angola's 20-year civil war. Both Kabila and Mobutu have used foreign forces in their seven-month standoff. Kabila has received help from Uganda and Rwanda; Mobutu used mercenaries from eastern Europe.

./samples/,"Zaire's prime minister resigned Monday, bowing to pressure from lawmakers who blamed him for mishandling an insurgency by rebels who have captured a third of the country. Leon Kengo wa Dondo's departure came a day after his mentor, President Mobutu Sese Seko, emerged from seclusion, promising to make clear ""within 48 hours"" his plans to reunite the country. ""The prime minister met the president of the republic...and he was obliged to present his resignation,"" said Zola Kinkela, secretary-general of Kengo's Union of Independent Democrats. Mobutu accepted Kengo's resignation and asked him to do everything he could to allow a new transitional government to take power, state TV reported. Mobutu, who returned Friday from an extended stay in Europe, himself did not appear on TV or issue any statements Monday. Parliament had voted a week earlier to oust Kengo, accusing him of being soft on the Tutsi-backed rebels because his mother is a Rwandan Tutsi. The Mobutu regime initially rejected the vote, saying it was unconstitutional because not enough legislators were present for a quorum. Mobutu's decision Monday to accept his hand-picked prime minister's resignation underscores the power struggle within the government as it struggles to deal with the rebel march across eastern Zaire. Opposition lawmakers planned to meet Tuesday to discuss a transitional government and urged all members of parliament to join them. Supporters of Etienne Tshisekedi, a popular opposition leader and longtime Mobutu foe, say he should take over as prime minister and begin talks with the rebels. Parliament elected Tshisekedi prime minister in 1992 but Mobutu refused to confirm him and instead backed Kengo for the job. Tshisekedi has pledged to negotiate with rebel leader Laurent Kabila, form a coalition government and prepare the country for its first multiparty elections. Mobutu's brief appearance Sunday put an end to rumors the 66-year-old leader, who has prostate cancer, was on his death bed. But his return did not ease tensions within his poorly paid army. Zairian soldiers in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi brawled Sunday in an apparent clash with would-be deserters, French radio said Monday. It was not immediately known if there were casualties. Kabila said Saturday his forces were only 125 miles from Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city. The rebels are trying to end Mobutu's 31-year dictatorship, during which they say he has robbed the country's vast mineral resources to make himself one of the world's richest men, while ordinary Zairians are mired in poverty. Just across the river in Brazzaville, Congo, the first wave of U.S. troops arrived Sunday to prepare for a possible evacuation of Americans from Zaire. An estimated 500 American civilians live in Zaire, about 320 of them in Kinshasa. Although the rebels are still far from Kinshasa, many fear a rampage by Zaire's poorly paid soldiers if Mobutu dies or the rebels continue their advance.","""1997-03-24T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8W10-000Y-K1XD-00000-00"""
./samples/,"US envoy Bill Richardson was expected in the Zairean capital Kinshasa on Monday on a mediation mission to bolster efforts for peace in war-ravaged Zaire. Richardson, the US ambassador to the United Nations, is due to meet ""senior leaders"" of the two sides in the lingering conflict, which is now into its seventh month. In Kinshasa, he was expected to meet President Mobutu Sese Seko before flying on for talks with rebel leader Laurent Kabila, whose forces are advancing on the capital after capturing more than half the country. country. ""The mission is open-ended at this point. His goal is to try and get the talks restarted, and we are putting no time limit on that,"" said White House spokesman Eric Rubin late Sunday. His mission comes after a diplomatic source in Pretoria, where rebel and government officials have been meeting, said Mobutu and Kabila had ""agreed in principle"" on a venue for talks early this week. ""They still have to sort out the transport and security details before they can call it a final agreement,"" the source added, but declined to name the location. The choice still seemed open Sunday, however. Kabila proposed the Zambian capital of Lusaka, without ruling out Libreville, the Gabonese capital, as an alternative. Gabonese president Omar Bongo has offered to host talks under the chairmanship of his South African counterpart Nelson Mandela. UN sources said Richardson would try to convince the two men to hold face-to-face talks, while seeking to persuade Mobutu to stand down gracefully and suggesting to Kabila he be more flexible. Richardson will press both sides to halt the fighting and start talks on a transitional government leading to elections. The 49-year-old Democratic former Congressman calls himself the ""under-secretary for thugs"" after carrying out delicate mediating missions in North Korea and Sudan. The US envoy will also discuss the humanitarian situation, with the fate of 85,000 Rwandan refugees who have disappeared from their camps south of rebel-held Kisangani top of the agenda. On Sunday, Kabila gave the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) 60 days to repatriate all the Rwandan refugees from the Kisangani region. In Kinshasa meanwhile, Mobutu supporters rallied on Sunday at a meeting of his Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR). In an address mixing calls for peace with pledges of a fight to the end, MPR interim head Mananga Dintoka Pholo warned Zaire could face ""100 years of war"" if no peaceful solution was found. In front of around 3,000 party militants, he urged the army to ""cleanse the humiliation"" heaped on the nation by the rebellion. Mananga reiterated Kinshasa's position that free elections must be held in which Mobutu would be allowed to stand. Kabila, for his part, has insisted the president must resign. The 66-year-old president is recuperating after prostate cancer surgery last summer. Kabila's rebels are closing on Kinshasa from the east and north. Press reports here, citing religious sources, say they are near to Kikwit, 400 kilometres (250 miles) east of the capital.

./samples/,"By Kevin McElderry KINSHASA, April 27 (AFP) - Supporters of beleaguered Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko warned Sunday of a 100-year war against the advancing rebel army if the rebels forced them out of the capital Kinshasa. Mananga Dintoka Pholo, the interim head of Mobutu's Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR) (eds: correct), told a party meeting that if the guerrillas chased Mobutu's supporters out of the country, they would just prepare their own rebellion in exile ""and Zaire will enter a war of at least 100 years."" In a rallying call to about 3,000 MPR militants, he also urged said peace talks between Mobutu and rebel chief Laurent Kabila must be held ""as soon as possible."" possible."" In Pretoria, a source said Saturday Kabila and Mobutu had ""agreed in principle"" on a venue for face-to-face peace talks early next week, but the agreement was not finalised. That failing, Mananga said, the army must ""cleanse the humiliation"" of the six-month rebellion. On Friday, the commander of the elite presidential guard, General N'Zimbi Ngbale ordered his troops to ""fight to the death"" to retake territory captured by the rebels. Mananga's speech was warmly applauded by MPR supporters, who--as is often the case here--were paid for their attendance. Mananga accused Kabila's forces of human rights abuses against tens of thousands of Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire by denying aid agencies access to them. He also attacked the international community for backing Kabila and said Zaire must never be split like North and South Korea. The rally in the main hall of the Palais du Peuple, the Chinese-built seat of Zaire's transitional government, began in a cacophony of sound and colour. To the sound of trumpets, horns and drums, choirs sang, danced and chanted as people arrived, many wearing clothes with Mobutu's image printed on or brandishing flags and placards pledging their support for him. ""No to weapons, yes to elections,"" one banner proclaimed inside the main hall of the Palais du Peuple. ""Hold tight Marshal, we support you,"" read a small flag in both French and lingala, the local language. Mananga said Mobutu, 66, was not being treated with the respect from the international community that he deserved. The ailing head of state is recovering after prostate cancer surgery last year. Sunday's rally came amid heightening tension in the capital with every report of rebel advances. They are approaching Kinshasa from the east--unconfirmed press reports here say they are 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Kikwit, one of the last major lines of defence before the capital a further 400 kilometres (250 miles) away. A second front is heading down from the north, while a third is widely expected from Bas-Zaire (Lower Zaire) province southwest of Kinshasa. ""Mobutu is our best hope. He is our candidate,"" an MPR supporter said, insisting that there was no popular feeling for Kabila. But a taxi driver working outside the building shook his head.

./samples/,"With rebel forces closing in, President Mobutu Sese Seko prepared today to leave the capital for what is billed as a three-day visit to neighboring Gabon. The president was expected to leave Wednesday and return Friday, according to Zairian and Western diplomats as well as a Mobutu aide who adamantly denied speculation that the president may be going into exile. Another aide, however, said the official word is that Mobutu, who has ruled Zaire for nearly 32 years, will return, but he expects the president instead to travel on to France. Both aides spoke only on condition of anonymity. Mobutu, 66, has a villa in France, which for decades helped to prop up his regime. He spent months there following prostate cancer treatment. The diplomats, also speaking on condition of anonymity, agree that Mobutu plans to leave Wednesday to meet in Gabon with President Omar Bongo and possibly the presidents of Togo and Congo. All three countries have been strong Mobutu supporters. Rebel leader Laurent Kabila, whose 70,000 troops have captured three-fourths of the central African nation in the past seven months, vowed Monday to storm the capital within days unless Mobutu immediately resigns. However, a spokesman for South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Kabila claimed in a telephone conversation today with Mbeki that he has suspended his advance on Kinshasa for eight to 10 days to give Mobutu time to respond. When pressed about Kabila's adamant denials earlier this week of talk of a cease-fire, and radio reports today that his troops have moved within 20 miles of Kinshasa, Mbeki spokesman Ricky Naidoo insisted: ""He said he has suspended his movement to Kinshasa."" Naidoo's comments could not be confirmed. U.S. envoy Bill Richardson, who met today with Mbeki in Cape Town, South Africa, said afterward that ""the peace process is very much alive. We are very encouraged."" He was expected to fly to Paris on Wednesday. For weeks, leaflets purportedly from the rebels have told Kinshasa residents that rebel forces were near and to prepare to welcome the new leadership. Kabila said Monday that the vanguard of his forces was 40 miles from Kinshasa's international airport and would be at the outskirts of the city of 6 million residents within days. Rebel spokesman Raphael Ghenda, speaking from the rebel-held southeastern city of Lubumbashi today, said rebels already are in the capital. In the past, Kabila has placed political operatives in cities he has targeted to obtain intelligence and to prepare citizens for the rebels' arrival. ""On our part, we would like to avoid bloodshed. Our main task is to protect the population against the extremists, against looting and against violence,"" Ghenda said. ""We will target only military installations in the city."" Mobutu and Kabila apparently made little progress toward ending the war during Sunday's talks aboard a South African naval ship docked in Pointe Noire, Congo. They agreed only to meet again within 10 days. The French Foreign Ministry said today that U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun was at the presidential palace to brief officials about the talks between Mobutu and Kabila. ""We firmly hope...for an end to hostilities without delay,"" its statement said. Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, delivered an urgent message to Kabila from President Clinton during their hourlong meeting Monday in Lubumbashi. ""We stressed our longstanding view that for the benefit of the Zairian people...there should be a peaceful entry into the capital of Kinshasa - a soft landing which avoids violence and chaos,"" Richardson said. The United States also wants an ""inclusive"" transitional government and fair and open elections, he said. Mobutu agreed that a transitional authority should be established to organize elections. He said he would hand over power to an elected authority. Kabila, whose forces control all but Zaire's far north and west, demands Mobutu immediately transfer power to the rebel alliance. The United States and other Western powers have troops stationed across the Zaire River in Congo and offshore to evacuate their nationals from Kinshasa, if needed. U.S. officials expressed growing concern Monday for the roughly 440 Americans in the city, worrying most about violence by Mobutu's forces.","""1997-05-06T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8B90-000Y-K073-00000-00"""

He added that his troops would continue to advance on Kinshasa because no cease-fire had been agreed during his meeting with President Mobutu on 4th May. "" Taking Kinshasa is on our agenda,"" Kabila said. He praised the South African and US attempts to end the crisis and said he regretted the stance adopted by France. He also rejected accusations concerning the maltreatment of refugees. The following is the text of a recorded interview with Ghislaine Dupont in Lubumbashi, broadcast by Radio France Internationale on 7th May; subheadings inserted editorially: [Dupont] Laurent-Desire Kabila, good morning. [Kabila] Good morning. The negotiations with Mobutu [Q] You are the president of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire [AFDL] and you met Marshal Mobutu on 4th May. After this meeting, it was noted that viewpoints continue to be so divergent that each side is sticking to its position. Are you going to continue to negotiate? [A] We are very serious about the problem of negotiations. We will continue to negotiate to avoid violence and bloodshed. It is true that we are obliged to negotiate. We are being very patient with Mr Mobutu. In any case, he recognized that we would be able to obtain what we could not obtain the other day within seven days. So we are waiting. [Q] Your troops will continue to advance as long as he does not tender his resignation? [A] There was no cease-fire, so I don't see why we should be messing around by marking time on the spot. Our troops are duty bound to advance. [Q] Do you think that militarily speaking you can capture Kinshasa without any risk? [A] It all depends on what type of risk you are referring to, but taking Kinshasa is on our agenda. [Q] Is it going to be within a short time? [A] It all depends again on Mr Mobutu's goodwill, if he has any goodwill. [Q] Marshal Mobutu has reportedly gone to Libreville. What do you think he is going to do in Libreville? [A] I cannot know. [Q] Do you have contacts with the Gabonese president? [A] We have contacts. Mr Bongo's position is very well known. [Words indistinct]. [Q] Do you think the Gabonese president can play a mediating role to replace the South Africans or in parallel with them? [A] In parallel? It is possible. Any man of goodwill accepted by both sides can play an important role in harmonizing the positions of the two sides. Praise for South Africa and the USA [Q] Are you satisfied with the South African mediation? [A] Yes, very satisfied. It is only that we have often been accused of not being willing to negotiate, although we are the only side who, for many long months, asked for negotiations. [Q] Up until now, the Americans appear to be supporting your alliance. Today, do you think there has been a shift in their position? [A I personally think the United States has not greatly changed its position. It is true that Mr Mobutu has to go; everybody agrees on that. Well, I have noted that the United States is doing a good job with Mr Mobutu. They have been making him conscious of the dangers he may face if he insists on clinging to power unnecessarily. [Q] But he is calling for a transitional government which will comprise all parties? [A] But he has been calling for a transitional government which has lasted seven years. Nobody is demanding that this transitional government should comprise people [words indistinct]. So, I do not think anybody should demand anything from me on what we are going to do. We have a lot of political friends in the Congolese [Zairean] opposition - in parties, movements and people in the civil society. We are going to form this transitional government of our own free will and not under any pressure. Hopes French position will change [Q] When France says there should be elections before anything, and that if you are a democrat you would prefer to hold elections, how do you respond to this position taken by France? [Kabila, laughing] It is the issue of the pot calling the kettle black. I think there is another section of France which thinks otherwise. I do not know which France you are talking about. [Q] By the way, some American officials are reported to have been holding meetings with you in Lubumbashi. Have any French officials already contacted you? [A] Oh, certainly. Quite certainly! We can present them to you, before the media tomorrow, if you like. They are people who have enormous responsibility in French political circles. They are important people and we must obtain their consent before I can disclose their names to the press. [Q] Do you regret the position taken by France? [A] Oh yes, of course. I hope this position will change. It means that one must obviously take into consideration that we have taken three-quarters of the country, and that we are really democrats, in spite of all that people try say to the mass media to discredit the alliance and myself. What represents our hope is that we have the capacity to modernize this country. France needs this country, which is one of the biggest Francophone countries. Rejects ""political"" accusations regarding refugees [Q] My last question, Laurent-Desire Kabila: You were criticized by the UN secretary-general on the problem of refugees. He accused you of having massacred refugees - [Kabila, interrupting] It is purely a political accusation to try to save a regime in Zaire which is crumbling. They are blaming the refugee problem on me as if I am in charge of the refugee problem. [EU official] Mrs Bonino has just spoken today accusing Mr Kabila [words indistinct] in the east. There is nothing like that, these are manipulations. [Q] And for what purpose? [A] Precisely because they want to force us to accept compromises, to accept their own agents, their own friends, who have destroyed our country. We cannot, in any way, work with them.","""1997-05-08T00:00:00Z""","""3SP2-9200-006F-X0JP-00000-00"""

""We think a period of three years will be enough to achieve the program we have set ourselves,"" the leader, Pierre Buyoya, a retired major who took power in a coup on July 25, said in a broadcast on Wednesday night. In his address, Mr. Buyoya urged Burundians to support his plans for a three-year transitional government ""at this serious point in our history."" He said he planned to include legislators from the previous National Assembly in a proposed parliament. But he gave no further details. He has previously said that a transitional parliament ""would include representatives from all walks of society."" Besides the powers held by the previous assembly, the new parliament ""will also play a determining role in the national debate and the attempts at national reconciliation,"" he added, without elaborating. He also repeated his earlier pledge to rein in the military, saying, ""We are to reinforce discipline, strictness and professional ethics among all the forces charged with maintaining law and order."" The Tutsi-dominated military has been accused of killing Hutu civilians in retaliation for attacks by Hutu rebels. The Hutu guerrillas have also been blamed for killing Tutsi civilians, especially those living in camps after the fighting drove them from their homes. Eighty-four percent of Burundi's people are Hutu, 14 percent are Tutsi and the rest are Twa. But the Tutsi have traditionally controlled the military and much of the economy. Mr. Buyoya has defended seizing power, saying he can stop the violence that has killed more than 500,000 people since the 1993 assassination of the country's first Hutu leader, Melchior Ndadaye, in a failed military coup. President Sylvestre Ntibantungaya, the Hutu leader ousted in last month's coup, remains at the residence of the United States Ambassador, Morris Hughes.

Preliminary estimates are that only 92.7 million voters out of 196.5 registered to do so actually turned out to cast their ballots....That's only 47 percent, the lowest since 1824....We can just imagine how this kind of turnout is viewed in other countries where people are dying to try to get the opportunity to vote. Have we as a nation become so jaded about politics that we no longer care?...We, as Americans, need to get involved in our system to help reform campaign finance laws and possibly the way candidates are chosen so that we can all get involved in the process of seeking a leader for our nation. --- Nov. 10 Daily News of Los Angeles, on state initiatives: One of the encouraging things about (the) election is that California voters, on the whole, rejected measures that would have harmed businesses, job growth and the state's economic recovery. They turned down special-interest propositions pushed by trial lawyers, two health-care measures that would have increased costs and encouraged featherbedding, and a retroactive increase in top-bracket income taxes that would have hurt start-up businesses that create new jobs....California's mood on election day was mirrored in other states, as voters elsewhere also largely withheld support for anti-business measures....In California, the election results were more than a rebuff to special interests. They amounted to a public acknowledgement of the importance of protecting and nurturing the state's job-producing, wealth-creating economy. --- Nov. 12 The Washington Post, on an environmental agenda: One of the things the president might usefully do before the next Congress convenes is lay out a clear environmental agenda. He ought to include not just a fairly specific list of proposals he would like to see enacted but a list of those that under no circumstances would he entertain. The lists would let him take charge of the greener side of things in a way that his first two Congresses he lamentably did not....There...seem to us to be at least three existing statutes in need of a certain amount of work. The Superfund program...needs to be made workable and somehting other than a lawyers' relief act. The Clean Water Act needs strengthening...to enable the states, if not the federal government directly, to get at the largest remaining source of pollution: the generalized agricultural and urban runoff across entire watersheds. And the Endangered Species Act needs to be converted into a pre-endangered species act so that necessary steps can be taken before a species is on the verge of being wiped out...Nov. 6 Quad-City Times, Davenport, Iowa, on presidential election: Victory is not a legacy. Bill Clinton won Tuesday, but not solely on the strength of his successes. Performance played a big role, of course; the president was re-elected because on his watch, our economy has grown stronger and the deficit has shrunk....But Tuesday's victory doesn't set Clinton's place in history. Much remains to be done. One glaring example is campaign finance reform. The parties and the candidates for federal office spent an estimated $1.6 billion on Campaign '96. That's obscene. Legislation that, at the least, bans special interest money and sets spending limits is a cause that President Clinton...could steer through the choppy waters it is sure to encounter. Medicare and Social Security also need to be repaired...not simply patched together with string and chewing gum. President Clinton can secure his place in history by shepherding creation of bipartisan programs for both. The nation's health-care system is not sound, and the welfare reform bill signed a few months back likely will need to be monitored and, if necessary, adjusted....--- Nov. 12 The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on constructive polarization: A number of commentators say Republicans dodged a bullet in last week's elections. The GOP retained majorities in (Congress) despite an onslaught for big-labor attack ads and Bill Clinton's easy re-election. Now what? Former Reagan administration official Don Devine, a thoughtful conservative, was on the right track when he told a Washington press conference last week that the GOP should be smarter in this next Congress... Devine isn't advocating a do-nothing approach. Far from it. What he's saying is Republicans need a legislative strategy that is more savvy politically...Further, Republicans must always keep in mind the president's habit of pretending to negotiate while preparing mendacious attack advertisements - the ""Clintonista"" strategy that gave the country ""Mediscare""' beginning in the winter of 1995-96. The Oklahoman suggests what might be called ""constructive polarization."" Republicans and conservatives must pick their fights with care - but when they fight, they should ""play"" to win on issues that will clarify their difference with Bill Clinton and his minions....--- Nov. 11 The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, on affirmative action and Texaco: Texaco Inc. could become the poster child for affirmative action. If ever a company debunks the notion that discrimination in the American workplace is dead and buried, that's the one. The tapes did it. In published excerpts, the tape revealed Texaco executives during meetings, casually and laughingly, deriding minority employees - using racial slurs and epithets - and planning to destroy documents demanded in an employee discrimination suit. The tapes...have plunged Texaco in scandal, sparking public outrage, customer complaints and threats of boycotts. In reaction...the company suspended two executives and ended medical and other benefits of two retirees. And Texaco chairman Peter Bijur said at a press conference the company was adopting a six-point program to improve the company's diversity efforts and was creating a special board committee to review its programs at every level. In addition, a prominent New York lawyer was appointed to work with the company to insure that all employees are treated ""with fundamental fairness.""...Yet Texaco's woes may yield some larger good. This revelation may put in better perspective the question: Is discrimination against minorities in the workplace a thing of the past? Not if you listen to the Texaco tapes. And not if you note the tens of thousands of discrimination lawsuit still filed each year by minorities....--- Nov. 5 The Herald of Rock Hill, S.C., on air bags, children's safety: The horror of doing everything by the book to protect a child in a car, only to have that child killed or seriously injured by an air bag, is awful to contemplate. But we hope this does not result in an effort to turn back the clock to a time when air bags were a rarity in U.S. autos. Soon, as decreed by federal law, all U.S.-made cars will have passenger-side air bags. But parents recently have received a chilling warning: No child under the age of 12 should ride in the front seat because of the danger posed by air bags....The government found that a 5-year-old boy, properly using an automobile's front seat belt, was killed by the force of an air bag. That is tragic, but no reason to indict air-bag technology. These devices are a proven lifesaver. Thousands of drivers have escaped death or serious injury because of air bags....We hope that manufacturers will work to improve air bags so they protect rather than endanger children. Meanwhile, we hope parents will heed the warning not to let children ride in the front seat in cars equipped with a passenger-side air bag....Nov. 11 The Straits Times, Singapore, on investment climate in Vietnam: The major complaint among foreign investors is that Vietnam is too bureaucratic and lacks transparency. Endemic corruption is another big headache. These are problems which the leadership must fix quickly in order to get rid of its dubious reputation as one of Asia's most difficult countries to do business in. The trouble is that the Vietnamese seem to be in two minds about making the transition to a market economy, largely because they want to have the cake and eat it. They are deeply suspicious of foreigners. They want foreign capital, but they also want to assert tight control over it. Somehow, they must learn that this is not the way a free market economy works, and the sooner they realize this, the easier they can clear the roadblocks. Right now, the outlook is not very bright ..."" --- Nov. 12 The Guardian, London, on the World Food Summit: The paradox facing the World Food Summit in Rome this week is no less grim for being very familiar. At an aggregate level, the world still has enough to eat. But...a large minority (800 million) struggle for food...Africa has the highest proportion of the chronically undernourished (41 percent)....Asia, in spite of its miracles, still has the highest number - over half a billion... The Rome conference is already being written off as a talking shop. In spite of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's efforts, no new money is expected to be generated. Of the G7, only the host country, Italy, is sending a senior figure. The crisis in Zaire will not be directly addressed. Please, just for once, could the world's leaders surprise us by taking seriously what remains the world's biggest shame? --- Nov. 12 The Jordan Times, Amman, on visit of Turkish foreign minister: Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller's visit to Jordan acquires an added meaning and significance because it is happening at a time when the Middle East is undergoing profound and rapid change politically, economically and otherwise. It is no secret that Jordan views Turkey as a major regional power and partner...As a neighbor, gateway to Europe and potential major supplier of water to the region, Ankara holds cards that are key to broadening and strengthening the peace between Israel and the Arab World. Since Turkey enjoys good relations with both the Israelis and the Arabs, we expect it to play a stabilizing role...On top of the common historical, religious and cultural heritage that our countries share, we can build a new political and economic edifice - a region as well. This, in essence, is what we hope Ciller's visit will achieve ultimately. --- Nov. 12 Arbeiderbladet, Oslo, on efforts to help refugees in Zaire: Humanitarian aid organizations are working desperately to reach more than 1 million refugees in eastern Zaire. The refugees have been without food and water for days. How many have died, no one knows. What we do know is that unfathomable numbers will die if they don't get help now. We are probably facing the worst humanitarian catastrophe of our time....A humanitarian intervention cannot be mounted without a U.N. mandate and the U.N. security council this weekend managed only to postpone the decision. The United States, Britain and Russia have shown particularly little interest in sending a force....If the U.N. only studies 'concepts' until Nov. 20, there is reason to believe there won't be many people left to help. The main responsibility rests on those who slowed the decision. But there is also reason to criticize the U.N. secretary general for not pounding his fist on the table with the force demanded by this situation. --- Nov. 9 Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on departure of Walter Mondale: (U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter) Mondale began work here by addressing a number of bilateral problems, including the auto dispute and deregulation, while an edgy feeling against each other embroiled the two nations at the grassroots level. Over the past three years, however, sharp criticism of Japan in Congress has significantly subsided. The outgoing ambassador has played a major role in turning around mutual resentment. In a typical example, Mondale served to calm Japanese anger over the gang-rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by U.S. servicemen....Mondale's swift and decisive action contrasted the initial procrastination of the Japanese government. We shall fondly remember Mondale, even though he may have lacked as much popularity among the Japanese and knowledge of the country and language as enjoyed by (Edwin) Reischauer. On the other hand, Mondale is more closely compared to (Mike) Mansfield in statesmanship and resourcefulness. With integrity and devotion, the three outstanding envoys have played a vital role in safeguarding and fostering bilateral ties across the Pacific. Hopefully the next ambassador from Washington will match their stature. --- Nov. 13 Basler Zeitung, Basel, Switzerland, on Jewish assets in banks: The amount found in Swiss banks by the banking ombudsman...after nearly a year of work is small: only around 11,000 francs could be traced to the heirs of the Jewish victims of the Nazi terror. But questions should be asked about the procedure. If the banks limit themselves to reacting to requests from descendants of Holocaust victims, this won't be enough to restore lost trust. They should do everything in their power to identify and find the rightful owners of unclaimed assets. The amount found raises the fear that 51 years after the end of the war only a small part of the 38.7 million francs the banks have themselves identified as unclaimed assets will be able to be traced back to its rightful owners. The miserable results so far show how justified the reproach is that the banks waited until the problem of Jewish assets went away by itself.","""1996-11-13T00:00:00Z""","""3SJ4-FMW0-0006-H1J6-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Relief workers on Monday located thousands of missing refugees in Zaire as rebels were reportedly poised to capture the town of Kikwit, the government's last major line of defense before the capital. Up to 10,000 of the 85,000 missing Rwandan Hutu refugees who fled camps near Kisangani last week were seen streaming out of dense tropical forests where they had sought refuge, a UN relief agency spokesman said. The refugees were on a road between 30 and 40 kilometers (20 and 25 miles) south of Kisangani, which is held by the rebels, he said. ""They were very frightened. The convoy picked up some of the infirm and ill,"" Paul Stromberg, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told AFP by telephone from Kisangani. kisangani. ""We hope there will be more and more of them."" UN World Food Programme (WFP) spokeswoman Michele Quintaglie said in Nairobi earlier that the relief workers found 6,000 to 7,000 refugees walking south towards the abandoned Biaro camp. She said her agency would send a train loaded with 115 tonnes of aid to the region later Monday. The refugees vanished from two camps south of Kisangani last Thursday and Friday after some of them clashed with local Zaireans. Their disappearance prompted concern among relief organizations who appealed to rebel leader Laurent Kabila to allow aid workers to find the refugees, many of whom are daily dying of starvation or disease. Kabila on Sunday gave the United Nations 60 days to round up and remove the refugees. His troops are meanwhile reportedly poised to capture Kikwit, the last major line of defense for the government which last week deployed there soldiers of the elite presidential guard (DSP). DSP units were sent to Kikwit partly as a defence but also to prevent looting and pillaging by soldiers of the regular army fleeing the fighting. A rebel official said in Lubumbashi that local residents had revolted against the elite troops who fled the town, but it was impossible to independently confirm the report. The fall of Kikwit, the economic capital of Bandundu province, would mark a major victory for the rebels following their capture in April of Lubumbashi, the second largest city in Zaire. The town, located on the main road to Kinshasa, supplies a good part of the capital with food and the rebels have vowed to take Kinshasa by ""squeezing it dry."" Their advance came as US pace envoy Bill Richardson arrived in Kinshasa Monday in a bid to mediate an end to the more than six-month crisis. The US ambassador to the United Nations told reporters he would meet early Tuesday with Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, and on Wednesday with Kabila in Lubumbashi. ""I am here to work with the leaders of Zaire to ensure a peaceful, prosperous and democratic future for the country,"" he said. The envoy, a veteran of delicate mediation missions, called for a negotiated settlement to the crisis in Zaire and the creation of a transitional government. UN sources said Richardson would try to convince archrivals Mobutu and Kabila to hold face-to-face talks, while seeking to persuade Mobutu to stand down gracefully and suggesting to Kabila that he be more flexible. The two men have been unable in recent weeks to agree on a venue to hold talks, with Mobutu insisting on a location close to home as he is recovering from cancer surgery and Kabila saying he would only discuss the president's stepping down. Kinshasa's newspapers did not hold out much hope of Richardson persuading Mobutu to stand down. ""Given the cussedness and elderly nature of the president, it is safe to say the US diplomat's mission is doomed to failure,"" wrote the pro-opposition Palmares daily. ""Unperturbed, the Marshal will no doubt reply that he will only quit power when the people ask him to (in elections).

./samples/,"Rebels said today that they have captured a town on the Zambian border and are closing in on the last government stronghold in eastern Zaire. The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire seized the town of Kasenga, 135 miles northeast of Lubumbashi, capital of the mineral-rich Shaba region, rebel spokesman Nyembwe Kazadi said from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Kazadi said rebel forces have continued past the town and are now about 60 miles from Lubumbashi. He Lubumbashi could fall before the first direct negotiations with President Mobutu Sese Seko's representatives, expected next week in South Africa. ""We won't stop moving,"" he said. ""The sooner the talks on the cease-fire, the better for them."" Under pressure from African leaders and foreign countries, the rebels, who are fighting to overthrow Mobutu's 31-year-old dictatorship, have agreed to negotiations that they hope will bring Mobutu down without further fighting. Since September, the rebels have swept through much of eastern Zaire, defeating undisciplined and poorly paid government troops. On March 15, they captured Kisangani, Zaire's third-largest city and then turned to the country's diamond capital, Mbuji-Mayi in Kasai, and the neighboring Shaba region, rich with cobalt and copper. The wealth of both regions is crucial to finance Mobutu's corrupt government, and the rebels apparently want control of them to secure their military victories and resources for their government. Kazadi did not have details on the capture of Kasenga, though he said it fell on Thursday. At the summit of the Organization of African Unity in Lome, Togo, the rebels said they would sent representatives to the talks to South Africa. But Kazadi said rebel leader Laurent Kabila will not go unless Mobutu, who is suffering from prostate cancer, also goes. Kabila arrived from Kisangani in the eastern city of Goma on Thursday. ""What we agreed is negotiations in order to get a cease-fire,"" he said. ""We're going to meet in South Africa one of these days...the date hasn't been set yet."" ""We want Mobutu to step down,"" he said, and again ruled out any power-sharing with Mobutu's government or political proxies. He said the aim of the alliance is to establish its control over the entire country, set up a transitional government under the alliance and then hold free elections. In Kisangani, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency said that for the first time in nearly two weeks, food has been delivered to some of the 100,000 exhausted Rwandan Hutu refugees who have collapsed along a railway that runs south to Ubundu from the Zaire River port city. ""People are in increasingly worse shape the further south you move,"" said Paul Stromberg. He said the rebels had asked the UNHCR not to bring the refugees through Kisangani and that they should be turned east and sent home. The rebels have given the United Nations a limited time to supply the refugees with medicine and food before they could be sent back to Rwanda. ""People were in terrible condition. Many are dying, sick from traveling, sitting on the roadside and unable to move,"" said Filipo Grandi, another UNHCR spokesman.

./samples/,"Zaire's Prime Minister Likulia Bolongo has called on residents of Kinshasa to denounce all suspect people, saying the army can defend the city against rebels but needs public support. In a television interview late Monday, General Likulia declared that the Zairean armed forces, the FAZ, was able to hold the city against rebels who have swept across the eastern half of the country, but needed ""the support of the people"". He claimed that inhabitants of all the towns conquered by Laurent Kabila's guerrillas since October were putting up ""strong resistance to the rebels"", but denounced wide divisions among Zairean politicians which had weakened the strength of the armed forces. Likulia also renewed Zairean charges that ""certain neighbouring countries"" had sent regular troops to fight for the mainly Tutsi rebel alliance, claiming that Kabila was dependent on help from these forces. Zaire has previously accused Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi of involvement, charges denied by all these countries. countries. On peace talks which have been under way in South Africa, Likulia said he was ""confident"" they would achieve a settlement. ""But if they collapse, the FAZ is ready to end a truce and resume fighting,"" he said. Frequently, Zaire's rag-tag army has looted and fled towns ahead of rebel advances and Kabila's men now control more than half the country, including the mineral-rich southeastern provinces crucial to the economy. Likulia said he would talk to the transitional parliament, the High Council of the Republic, on the situation in the country, where ""the state coffers are empty"", but for notes with a face value of between 100,000 and one million new zaires. 180,000 new zaires are worth one dollar, but the biggest note in circulation is the 50,000 new zaire bill, because Zaireans refuse to take other notes arguing that they will worsen inflation. On Monday, the United States urged Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and Kabila to hold talks in South Africa, lamenting the difficulty in arranging the meeting. It is ""important for the rebels and the government to respond favorably to the South African proposal"" for a summit, said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns. Obstacles to holding the meeting were ""quite disappointing, because we think the only way that any progress is going to be made in the current civil war in Zaire"" is through such dialogue, Burns said. Washington will give ""all necessary support"" to the efforts of the South African government and the UN special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun to arrange the direct talks, he said. The question was raised during a meeting early Monday between Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and South African Vice President Thabo Mbeki. Sahnoun said Monday that there is ""still a small hope to concretize the meeting."" He told AFP that both parties ""continue to say they're ready"" to meet. Last Thursday, Sahnoun and South African Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Aziz Pahad, peace mediators in the ongoing conflict, announced in Cape Town that the two foes had agreed to meet. But Saturday, Kabila toughened his position, saying he only would meet Mobutu to discuss the conditions for the president's departure, while the head of state refuses to stand down. The rebels have seized all key cities apart from the capital Kinshasa and are seeking to oust Mobutu, ruler for the past 32 years. bbos/nb/ns AFP France wants to see a transitional government set up in Zaire leading to national reconciliation, said foreign ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt on Tuesday.

./samples/,"Regional leaders called a summit over the coup in Burundi as talks continued here Sunday on the fate of its deposed Hutu leaders, including the ousted president. In Kampala, the presidents of Tanzania and Uganda, Benjamin Mkapa and Yoweri Museveni, ""strongly condemned and rejected"" Thursday's army-backed bloodless coup which ousted President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya. They announced that a regional summit would be held on Wednesday in Arusha, northern Tanzania. Ntibantunganya has been holed up in the US ambassador's residence here since Tuesday. He sought shelter after being attacked by stone-throwing crowds at a funeral for 340 Tutsis, victims of ethnic massacres. Several ministers sought refuge in the Belgian, French and German embassies. Ntibantunganya was replaced by Major Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi, who declared himself interim president and announced he would form a transitional government. On Sunday, Buyoya said he wanted the deposed leaders to stay in Burundi, saying he would offer them security and a chance to take part in transitional powers. Burundi's 5.5 million population is 85 percent Hutu and 14 percent Tutsi. World leaders fear the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people in three years could degenerate into a bloodbath similar to the one in Rwanda in 1994 which left 500,000 dead. The announcement by Mkapa and Museveni followed weekend talks with former Tanzanian head of state Julius Nyerere, the principal African mediator in the Burundi conflict. Their statement said: ""The military coup undermines the efforts being undertaken by both regional and world leaders aimed at finding a peaceful and lasting solution to the Burundi conflict that would guarantee security and democracy to all the people of Burundi."" Ugandan government sources said Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire, Kenya and Ethiopia would take part in the summit. Leaders of those same countries met on June 25 in Arusha where they agreed to a Burundi government request for military intervention to halt inter-ethnic bloodshed in the west African state. That decision was heavily criticised by many in Burundi and the peacekeeping force failed to materialise amid internal squabbles between Ntibantunganya and his Tutsi Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo, who resigned after the coup. Mkapa and Museveni underlined ""the importance of the agreement reached at the regional summit"" and called on all parties to respect its recommendations. Ugandan government sources also revealed Museveni had received a delegation from Buyoya on Saturday. Uganda is considered the neighbour most favourable to the Tutsi minority in Burundi and Rwanda, while Tanzania is considered closer to the Hutus. No country has yet recognised Burundi's new authorities. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) condemned the coup. Many western countries, however, despite initial outrage, have largely contented themselves with deploring the interruption of the democratic process in Burundi--a process initiated by Buyoya during his last term in office. Buyoya came to power in 1987 after a coup which ousted then Tutsi president Jean-Baptise Bazaga. He launched a democracy drive which ended in his defeat in the 1993 presidential election. Four months later Melchior Ndadaye, the country's first elected Hutu president, was assassinated in a coup bid by the Tutsi-dominated army. In another development Sunday, Johannesburg's Sunday Independent said former apartheid agents were shipping illegal arms to Hutu rebels in Burundi and Rwanda. Meanwhile, Pope John Paul II led 6,000 people in prayer for the population of Burundi at his summer residence at Castel Gandolfo near Rome. vm-sa/jl/km AFP Former apartheid agents and officials continue to ship illegal South African weapons to be used in conflict-torn Burundi and Rwanda, a report said here Sunday. Citing a South African arms investigation commission member and unnamed pilots and cargo crews, Johannesburg's Sunday Independent newspaper said arms, explosives and communications equipment are flowing out of South Africa and Angola to Hutu extremist rebels in Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire. The newspaper said the trade is controlled by the same unnamed people who once sold weapons on the black market for South Africa's former white minority government. ""In the past few weeks, journalists in Angola have seen planeloads of weapons on Tajiki and Uzbeki cargo planes piloted by Russians,"" the newspaper said. ""Many Russian pilots are employed by South African cargo companies that are said to be involved in the illicit trade."" Pilots often make stopovers in the northeastern Angolan diamond town of Saurimo, the Sunday Independent said. Some weapons find their way to northern Zambia where they are shipped by boat on Lake Tanganyika to Burundi and Zaire, the report said. On Thursday, Burundi's government was taken over by Major Pierre Buyoya in a bloodless coup that has prompted fears of further bloodshed in the troubled country, where tens of thousands have died in recent years. Hutu rebels continue to battle the Tutsi-dominated military, with hundreds of thousands of civilians forced to flee their homes. In Rwanda, covert attacks on rural villages by Zaire-based Hutu rebels continue to take place more than two years after a massacre in which an estimated 500,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus died. Rwanda's new Tutsi-dominated military has also been accused by the United Nations of conducting much smaller massacres against civilians. The Sunday Independent quoted Laurie Nathan, a member of a South African commission investigating arms sales, as saying the trade is linked to diamond smuggling in Angola and Zaire. ""The principal players are (rebels with Angola's UNITA group), elements in Zaire and South African private companies and individuals,"" Nathan told the newspaper. ""The Commission has received a growing amount of evidence of illegal arms shipments from South Africa over the last 12 to 18 months to other countries in Africa, including Angola, Zaire and Rwanda."" South Africa's government has not sanctioned the deals, which could involve hundreds of tonnes of rifles, handguns, explosives and two-way field radios, the report said. During the apartheid era, South Africa was a leading weapons supplier to Rwanda's old Hutu regime, selling 50.2 million dollars worth of arms between 1990 and 1993. The trade officially stopped following the 1994 Rwandan genocide, but the United States-based Human Rights Watch said last year that South Africa continued to ship illegal weapons to Rwanda. The group said several plane shipments of arms were flown from South Africa to the Kivu region in Zaire, where Rwandan Hutu militias are based. South Africa tightened its arms export rules last year, and disallowed the state-owned military hardware company Armscor the right to issue export licenses. The Rwandan government says at least 150 tonnes of small arms, grenades and explosives were ferried to the region on Lake Tanganyika from a Zambian port. gam/gd AFP","""1996-07-28T00:00:00Z""","""3TDD-VBV0-0031-V0HY-00000-00"""

""I'm afraid of what happened after we got independence in 1960,"" said Paul Kapinda, an unemployed economist who was born the same year the Belgian colonial leaders left. ""We were promised democracy, but we got a dictator. Will Kabila be another Mobutu?"" Whether Kabila can lead a country, not just a rebellion, becomes a more pressing issue as President Mobutu Sese Seko's health deteriorates and his government collapses. ""Mobutu was a military man; we don't need another one as president,"" said Claude Otshudi, a psychology student at the University of Kisangani. ""We want a civilian as president."" Kabila, 56, clearly enjoys the power he now yields. Sometimes he says he will be president of Zaire, but only for a short time and only if the people want him. Other times he says he wants to win the revolution, then retire to private life. Sometimes his actions contradict his words. Last week, Kabila banned all political parties but his own. He said it was a temporary measure to prevent Mobutu from stopping the advance of his troops, who are about 125 miles from Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city. A transitional government will be formed exclusively by the rebels' Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, he said. ""We are in the process of liberation. If we accept political parties, they will tell lies to stop the advance of the Alliance,"" Kabila said. ""We can't accept this distraction in the face of an enemy."" Kabila's friend, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, similarly banned political parties when he led a coup there in 1986. More than a decade later, the ban remains. No one complained, at least not openly, about Kabila's ruling. ""We're all part of the Alliance now,"" said Eric Joseph Lunganga, vice president of the Democratic Union for Social Progress, the main opposition party led by Etienne Tshisekedi. Perhaps Lunganga was untroubled because his party members and supporters swept the ""election"" that was held in Kisangani after the rebels captured the strategic city on the Zaire River in mid-March. Swiftly installing a civilian administration in each bit of captured territory seems to be a rebel strategy to come across as liberators rather than conquerors. With a show of hands at a soccer stadium, Democratic Union president Yaghi Sitolo was elected governor, a sign of the party's strong organization on the ground, compared to the Alliance's. When Kabila's savvy young ""Cabinet ministers"" arrived last week in Kisangani, they immediately set about trying to persuade residents to be for the Alliance, not just against Mobutu. They met with businessmen, politicians and religious leaders, and they didn't balk at awkward questions such as, ""What makes Kabila any better than Mobutu?"" ""A few days ago you couldn't walk the streets without government soldiers robbing you,"" said the rebels' self-proclaimed justice minister, Mwenze Kongolo. ""Our soldiers don't steal. They buy what they want. Before we came, there was a curfew, you couldn't even sit out on your own porch at night. President Mobutu didn't let you vote for your own leaders. We will."" There were other, smaller signs that the rebels are trying to be different. They paid civilian truck drivers for hauling troops and munition to Kisangani, handing over huge stacks of bank notes bearing Mobutu's likeness, each stack worth about $200. The Zairian government pays its soldiers $1 a month, if at all. Rebel soldiers are widely viewed here as outsiders. Most are Banyamulenge, Tutsis of Rwandan descent from the eastern border area of Zaire. ""This is what I tell people, it's time that the dream of Martin Luther King comes true, even in this country,"" said the rebel finance minister, Mwamana Nanga Mawampanga. ""We try to explain to people, don't look at us or these young soldiers from where they come, or which language they speak or which ethnic group they are, but by what they are doing. These kids are out there 24 hours a day to protect you and your freedom."" In this vast, mineral-rich country of more than 200 tribes, most people say they will support any government that allows them to live in peace and prosperity, regardless of its ethnic composition. ""Mobutu treated his tribe like royalty. He saved the best for his brothers,"" said PiliPili Mukobelwa, a Bukavu taxi driver. ""Kabila...has a chance to do things right. If he has good ideas, and he does, people will follow him.""","""1997-03-25T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8VN0-000Y-K17N-00000-00"""
./samples/,"(UPDATES with refugees return, camp scene, UN and UN rejection of deadline) KISANGANI, Zaire, April 28 (AFP) - Thousands of missing Rwandan refugees emerged from the dense Zairean forest Monday as rebels were reportedly poised to capture the town of Kikwit, the government's last major line of defence before the capital. The refugees began streaming out of the jungle, many of them starving and exhausted, and headed for the camp at Biaro that they fled last week following clashes with local Zaireans. Men, women and children, they emerged in small groups carrying bundles on their heads and babies in their arms. Reporters who reached the Biaro camp said they found a grisly sight, with around 20 rotting corpses strewn around and the smell of decomposition lying heavy on the air. air. Among the corpses were a baby and a woman, her mouth open, covered with flies. Her skull bore the mark of a large head wound, possibly inflicted by a machete. Aid workers who have begun searching for the missing thousands estimate that between 5,000 and 10,000 returned from their inhospital refuge Monday and made for the camp from where they are to be repatriated to neighbouring Rwanda. Rebel leader Laurent Kabila has given the international community a 60-day ultimatum to repatriate all refugees from eastern Zaire, after which he would accomplish the task himself. Relief workers believe more than 85,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees are missing after they fled their camps last week. Both the United States and the United Nations rejected the deadline. In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said that ""to issue an ultimatum now, particularly when the refugees are scattered, is most unhelpful."" He said it was ""unreasonable...and unacceptable....We call upon Mr. Kabila to give all support by the rebel alliance to the evacuation efforts of the United Nations."" The UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said the 60-day deadline was ""unrealistic"" and unlikely to be met. The assessment was also made by UN chief Kofi Annan's spokesman and the UN Security Council on the grounds that the whereabouts of up to 300,000 refugees in eastern Zaire were still not known. Ogata told journalists after briefing the Security Council that ""repatriation would be one of the least worst options"" for the mainly Hutu refugees. However a start would be made, she said. UN World Food Programme (WFP) spokeswoman Michele Quintaglie said in Nairobi that her agency would send a train loaded with 115 tonnes of aid to the Kisangani region later Monday. Kabila's troops were meanwhile reportedly poised to capture Kikwit, the last major line of defense for the government which last week deployed there soldiers of the elite presidential guard (DSP). Late Monday, a Catholic official with contacts at Idiofa, a small town 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kikwit, said the town had fallen to the rebels who had encountered no resistance. The Zairean authorities neither denied nor confirmed the report. DSP units were sent to Kikwit partly as a defence but also to prevent looting and pillaging by soldiers of the regular army fleeing the fighting. A rebel official said in Lubumbashi that local residents had revolted against the elite troops who fled the town, no independent confirmation was available. The fall of Kikwit, the economic capital of Bandundu province, would mark a major victory for the rebels following their capture in April of Lubumbashi, the second largest city in Zaire. The town, located on the main road to Kinshasa, supplies a good part of the capital with food and the rebels have vowed to take Kinshasa by ""squeezing it dry."" Their advance came as US pace envoy Bill Richardson arrived in Kinshasa Monday in a bid to mediate an end to the more than six-month crisis. The US ambassador to the United Nations told reporters he would meet early Tuesday with Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, and on Wednesday with Kabila in Lubumbashi. ""I am here to work with the leaders of Zaire to ensure a peaceful, prosperous and democratic future for the country,"" he said, calling for a negotiated settlement to the crisis in Zaire and the creation of a transitional government. UN sources said Richardson would try to convince archrivals Mobutu and Kabila to hold face-to-face talks, while seeking to persuade Mobutu to stand down gracefully and suggesting to Kabila that he be more flexible. burs/bb bb","""1997-04-28T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-3920-0025-F020-00000-00"""

./samples/,"Zairian rebels said Friday that they have captured a town on the Zambian border near Lubumbashi the last government stronghold in eastern Zaire. Forces of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire seized Kasenga, 220 kilometers (137 miles) northeast of Lubumbashi, which is the capital of the mineral-rich Shaba region, rebel spokesman Ngembwe Kazadi said from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. ''They are not far from Lubumbashi...little more than 100 kilometers (60 miles),''  Kazadi said. Kazadi said Lubumbashi could fall before the first direct negotiations with President Mobutu Sese Seko's representatives in South Africa, expected next week. ''We won't stop moving,''  he said. ''The sooner the talks on the cease-fire, the better for them.''  Under pressure from African leaders and the international community, the rebels have agreed to negotiations which they hope will bring Mobutu down without further fighting. Since September, the rebels have swept through much of eastern Zaire, defeating Mobutu's undisciplined and poorly paid government troops. On March 15, they captured Kisangani, Zaire's third-largest city, and then turned to the country's diamond capital, Mbuji-Mayi, and the neighboring Shaba region, rich with cobalt and copper. Kazadi did not have details on the taking of Kasenga. He said the town, which is at Johnson's Falls and connected by road to Lubumbashi, fell on Thursday. At the summit of the Organization of African Unity in Lome, Togo, the rebels said they would sent representatives to the talks to South Africa. But Kazadi said the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, will not go unless Mobutu, ill with prostate cancer, goes also. Kabila came to the eastern city of Goma from Kisangani on Thursday. ''What we agreed is negotiations in order to get a cease-fire,''  he said. ''We're going to meet in South Africa one of these day....The date hasn't been set yet.''  ''We want Mobutu to step down,''  he said, and ruled out again any power-sharing with ''Mobutists''  a reference to Mobutu's government and political proxies. He said the aim of the alliance is to take control of the entire country, set up a transitional government and hold free elections.

./samples/,"Zairean rebels called Sunday on all government soldiers to lay down their arms as they had advanced to the ""outskirts"" of the capital Kinshasa. The rebel Voice of the People radio station said ""it was only a matter of days"" before they would seize the city. The radio described talks between ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel chief Laurent Kabila ""as the start for a new country"". Earlier United Nations special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun said talks between Mobutu and Kabila reached no agreement. Speaking aboard a South African naval vessel on which Mobutu and Kabila met at the Congo port of Pointe-Noire, Sahnoun said the two men would meet again in eight to ten days time with South African President Nelson Mandela. According to a communique issued at the end of the first face-to- face meeting aboard the SAS Outinique, Kabila had proposed that his rebel alliance form a transitional government in Kinshasa and Mobutu resign, according to South Africa's SAPA news agency. As a gesture of goodwill Kabila had ordered his forces to stop their advances on all fronts. That was, however, not a formal ceasefire, noted Mandela, who chaired the meeting. Mandela said that Mobutu had ""cooperated very well to make this agreement possible"" and the South African leader had similar praise for Kabila, of whom he said, ""This is a leader in whom I have maximum confidence."" Mobutu had proposed a ceasefire, according to the communique. The proposed transitional government should organise democratic elections in Zaire, Mobutu also said adding that he would resign only after the election of a new president. Mobutu had boarded the SAS Outeniqua Sunday and met Kabila at the negotiating table for the first time, ending two days of on-off speculation about the talks. South African sources had earlier said there had been a proposal for Kabila to head an interim government along with a member of the Zairean opposition, possibly Etienne Chisekedi. Chisekedi had been appointed prime minister by Mobutu in April, but was dismissed three days later because he wanted to include in his government members of Kabila's rebel movement. In another development scores of refugees were crushed to death boarding a train taking them to a repatriation centre in Kisangani, according to reports from eastern Zaire. Dozens of other refugees were injured, said the radio reports, quoting U.N. refugee officials. The train reportedly was waiting to make its regular run between a refugee camp at Biaro to Kisangani, 40 kilometres to the north, where the refugees were to be processed for repatriation to Rwanda. A U.N. refugee official was quoted as saying panic broke out during the boarding process and scores of people were crushed to death. Aid workers said the repatriation by air to Rwanda of mainly Hutu refugees from areas of eastern Zaire was continuing. So far 4,000 had been flown home. A spokesman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Paul Stromberg, said that after initial protests the UNHCR now thought it would be possible to comply with rebel demands that the repatriation of some 80,000 Hutus be completed by end of June. On Saturday alone, he said, about 1,000 had been repatriated. But he cautioned that only about half of the estimated 80,000 who fled refugee camps two weeks ago in the face of armed rebel attacks had found their way out of the jungle to assembly camps. The meeting between Kabila and Mobutu was originally planned for Friday. However, Kabila failed to turn up, saying he was concerned about talks security and demanding the United States be excluded. For a time Saturday it was unclear whether talks would ever come about after Kabila snubbed Mobutu Friday, refusing to fly to the ship by helicopter from Luanda while Mobutu and Mandela were on board. Rebel spokesmen in Paris gave yet another explanation Saturday for Kabila's non-attendance. In a statement to a French news agency, they said Mobutu's delegation included witchdoctors and hypnotists who had been assigned to cast spells on Kabila. On Friday, Mobutu's ill health caused almost five hours of delay because he could not climb the 31 metal steps to get aboard the ship. The problem was finally solved by lowering a make-shift ramp over which he was driven by car on board the vessel. dpa rg","""1997-05-04T00:00:00Z""","""3RPR-R4V0-0094-N4JB-00000-00"""

Prior to his departure early Tuesday, Annan met with a group of UNITA deputies who, for the first time since the 1994 peace accords were signed, were due to sit in parliament. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) gained 70 seats in elections in 1992, but they remained vacant when the civil war resumed. resumed. In a meeting Monday with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, Annan received assurances that the deputies would sit in parliament and that UNITA cabinet members would be arriving in Luanda by Wednesday. No date was set, however, on the formation of a government of unity and national reconciliation. The peace accords allowed Savimbi to appoint four government ministers and seven junior ministers. Savimbi's change of heart came after receiving assurances from the government over a number of key issues, including the creation of a special status for the former rebel leader. The breakthrough announcement led Annan to say afterwards: ""I am convinced that the main obstacle to peace has been lifted. ""We are on the last lap of a very long race,"" Annan later told members of a joint commission for the implementation of the peace accords, signed in Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994. But Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura warned Annan to be cautious about Savimbi's pledges and to impose, if necessary, UN sanctions againt the former rebel movement. Despite the sudden lurch forward in the political arena, there has been little progress on the military side. Integration of the former UNITA troops into the new national army is slow, with only 7,000 men joining out of an expected 26,300. To make matters worse, the demobilisation of some 100,000 former soldiers is still only in its initial phase. The country is also in need of 230 million dollars to assist the former soldiers along with the displaced and refugees. ""The implementing of the accords has gone lamentably slowly. There are many frustrations and disappointments,"" Annan said Monday, urging the government and former rebels to implement the rest of the accords without delay. ""Nothing would give me more satisfaction, as an African, than to see an end to the last internal conflict in southern Africa,"" added Annan, a Ghanaian.

./samples/,"The blue-and-white UN flag will be lowered here for the last time Friday as the ""Blue Helmets"" pull out of Rwanda despite continuing clashes between Tutsis and Hutus following the genocidal civil war in 1994. The UN troops are withdrawing at the insistence of the Rwandan government, which regards their presence here as an affront to its dignity. The official deadline is midnight New York time on Friday--7:00 in the morning on Saturday here--but the soldiers will parade Friday afternoon and lower the flag then, spokesman Ismael Diallo told AFP. The 1,230 soldiers and 146 military observers, plus the civilian staff, will have six weeks to leave--until April 19. They arrived on October 5, 1993 to oversee the establishment of a transitional government envisaged in an agreement signed by the then Hutu government and Tutsi opposition to end a three-year-long low-level civil war. But on April 6, 1994, the plane carrying president Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down over Kigali and the country plunged into a bloobath, with Hutu extremists slaughtering more than 500,000 men, women and children before being defeated by a rebel army of the minority Tutsis. The UN troops, 5,500-strong at their peak, came under strong criticism then for doing nothing to prevent the genocide, and also after the war, when troops of the new Tutsi-dominated army massacred Hutus in a displaced persons' camp as UN soldiers looked on. But their departure, analysts say, is likely to increase the fears of the 1.7 million Hutus living in refugee camps in neighbouring countries. Only a handful are returning, despite Kigali's assurances of the safety of the innocent. General Paul Kagame, the strongman of Rwanda who led the Tutsi troops to victory and is now vice president, summed up the government's feelings about the Blue Helmets recently when he said: ""We are not a country under tutelage--it is up to the government to undertake its responsibility to ensure the security of Rwandans."" But Rwanda remains a dangerous place, with constant clashes between the army and Hutu guerrillas, members of the defeated army and militias who slip across the border from Zaire. The French newspaper Liberation reported last month that Tutsi soldiers had killed at least 100,000 Hutu civilians in cold blood since the war ended in July, 1994, a charge rejected by the government, although Kagame acknowledged last November in an interview with a UN human rights magazine that soldiers had committed unsanctioned excesses, including the killing of civilians, and that 600 soldiers were then in prison for assassinations, crimes of vengeance, and theft. But he said then, in response to similar allegations of widespread killings by the military, that it would have been impossible to hide them in view of the number of Blue Helmets and UN human rights observers in the country. The human rights observers--now numbering 80--will stay on after the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) pulls out. Spokesman Lee Woodyear said the government had asked that their number be increased to 300, but that the final number would depend on the operation's budget. Other UN agencies such as the children's fund and the refugee agency will remain too, but the future of many UNAMIR operations remained clouded Thursday. One is a radio station which broadcasts in Kiyarwanda, French and English and has won respect for its news bulletins, which do not hesitate to describe massacres. ""I just don't know"" what will happen to it, Diallo acknowledged. Staff at the radio station did not know either--they were waiting for a UN Security Council debate on the end of the mission--but were hoping that other UN agencies might take it over. Diallo acknowledged that as a possibility, but pointed out it would have to change its name from Radio UNAMIR. Another unknown factor is the fate of the full-scale UN hospital here, which Diallo said might be run by a combination of UN agencies. The multi-million dollar question is what happens to UNAMIR's equipment--the vehicles, transmission equipment, computers, office furniture and portable housing. Some has already been shipped to UN peacekeeping operations in Liberia and Angola, Diallo said. The government wants the rest--for free--but Diallo made it clear that priorities were first other UN peacekeeping missions, then other UN agencies in Rwanda, adding that some countries which had lent equipment wanted it back.

Richardson, who met here with French officials, refused to comment on speculation that Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko, 66 and suffering from prostate cancer, could take refuge at his villa in France. International mediators are working for ''a soft landing to the crisis, that is, a peaceful transition of power, avoiding further bloodshed in the country and chaos and violence in the capital of Kinshasa,''  Richardson told a Paris news conference. Richardson was in Paris to brief French diplomats after his 9-day round of shuttle diplomacy, which included several meetings with Mobutu and rebel alliance leader Laurent Kabila. ''I told Kabila an alliance military victory is within reach, but the political future of Zaire is at stake,''  Richardson said. Richardson refused to say whether Mobutu would soon go into exile, but all but acknowledged Mobutu's nearly 32-year reign was coming to an end. ''The ultimate solution will involve a transitional government _ there's going to be a change in Zaire,''  he said. Mobutu went to Gabon, Richardson said, ''to discuss...the next steps for him to take, and eventually there would be a return to Kinshasa.''  ''The next few days are critical for peace in Zaire,''  he said. Richardson said he also met Thursday morning with U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun, who helped put together a peace plan. Sahnoun met with French officials earlier this week. Richardson said there was ''a good chance''  Mobutu and Kabila will meet again to negotiate a solution, and called their first meeting last Sunday on a South African naval ship off the Congolese coast ''successful''  despite the ongoing fighting. South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Wednesday that preparations were under way for another round of talks between the two rivals next Wednesday. Neither Mobutu nor Kabila, however, has publicly committed to the fresh talks. A group of regional leaders meeting with Mobutu in Gabon called Wednesday for Mobutu and Kabila to meet again within 10 days, as agreed at the peace talks last Sunday. French officials also have refused to comment on speculation that Mobutu could retire to his villa on the Riviera, where he convalesced on and off for months after an August operation.

After his meeting with President Mobutu [Sese Seko] in southern France yesterday Etienne Tshisekedi spoke to Yves Rocle: [Rocle - recording] Etienne Tshisekedi, hello. [Tshisekedi] Hello. [Q] You are the leader of the radical opposition in Zaire. Yesterday you went to Roquebrune Cap-Martin in southern France to meet Marshal Mobutu who is convalescing there. Why did you go to see Mobutu, given that you have long been at loggerheads with him and were sacked from the post of prime minister by him in 1993? [A] We are politicians first and foremost, and in politics personal feelings are set aside. We care first of all for the higher interest of our people. This is why I came to France, to pay a sympathy visit to President Mobutu, who is ill, and, secondly, through that visit to signify that which has been long awaited by our people as a whole and which we describe as national reconciliation. [Q] Precisely on that point, Mr Tshisekedi, how do you define national reconciliation? [A] But you have just said it yourself, because for some time President Mobutu used to say, I don't wish to cohabit with Mr Tshisekedi precisely because Mr Tshisekedi is - he said - a quarrelsome person. Now the law, the constitutional act, the constitution that regulates our country's affairs during the transition period makes it mandatory that the presidency be led - animated - as we call it - by President Mobutu, and that the government be animated by the person elected to that end at the Sovereign National Conference. Now, with the reconciliation we have just had, President Mobutu will no longer oppose this and will therefore respect the constitutional act whereby I lead the government which we call a government of national unity - [interrupted by Rocle] [Q] So as of this morning you regard yourself again as the prime minister of Zaire. [A] Absolutely. [Q] What will happen to the current prime minister, Kengo wa Dondo? [A] He was the West's prime minister, not the Zairean people's prime minister. [Q] You have the agreement of Marshal Mobutu, of the president of the Zairean republic, that you should become the prime minister of Zaire? [A] But that is obvious, it follows from this national reconciliation . [Q] So are you now going to form a government? [A] Which we call a national unity government. So, on my return to Kinshasa we shall endeavour to engage in the necessary consultations with a view to receiving from President Mobutu's [political] family the names of agreed ministers so that on this occasion it may effectively be a national unity government. So there is nothing new in this, it was already envisaged after the end of the Sovereign National Conference. [Q] To your knowledge, has Marshal Mobutu already informed Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo of his decision? [A] I am not President Mobutu, so I cannot answer your question. [Q] You are indeed not President Mobutu, but you met him, you reached an agreement with him. Must Mr Kengo wa Dondo indeed now go? [A] My friend, it is up to you to draw the logical conclusions from what I have just told you. [Q] Mr Tshisekedi, was it the situation in Kivu which motivated you to take that step last night in the company of President Mobutu? [A] This situation you speak about in Kivu demands a solution, and in my opinion the solution can only come from a government which has the support of the people, because it is essentially an internal problem. Consequently, what I have done is the essential thing - that is, reconciliation between the two political families. As I have just told you, the rest will follow on: the government of [national] unity will be formed and will among other things tackle these problems in the east. [Q] But how did you yourself feel about this defeat of the Zairean army in Kivu? Are you on the same wavelength as President Mobutu? [A] It is for the president - we are in a pluralist society - to make his assessment. But you are speaking to Mr Tshisekedi wa Mulumba. My conviction is that this problem is essentially an internal Zairean one. [Q] So you do not believe in the theory of Rwandan aggression? [A] For the moment, I do not see what that is all about. Those are useless speculations. I am a leader; I prefer to tackle solving problems rather than making commentaries. I am not a man in the street. [Q] Laurent Kabila, who has presented himself as the leader of these rebels in eastern Zaire, is also a long-standing opponent of Marshal Mobutu. He has proposed a common front for all opposition members; and nevertheless you have chosen not to heed that call? [A] Kabila is a citizen of the country, and everyone, including Kabila, whether they were inside or outside Zaire, adhered to this project of the Sovereign National Conference. Consequently, when I tell you we have resolved this problem - Mr Kabila has adhered to this project - he is bound to do well out of it, because it is a problem which has been resolved by the Zairean family, the Zairean people. [Q] Are you stretching out a hand to Laurent Kabila? [A] You can already consider it that way, yes. [Q] So do you think the Kivu problem can be resolved through negotiation? [A] It has to be resolved through negotiation. I think we have spilt enough of our people's blood not to be able to allow ourselves the luxury of spilling the blood of one more single Zairean. [Q] Etienne Tshisekedi, thank you.","""1996-11-23T00:00:00Z""","""3S4Y-DTB0-0017-G51T-00000-00"""

./samples/,"A summary of top world news Saturday: KINSHASA, Zaire - Zaire's rebels marched into the capital virtually unopposed and their leader Laurent Kabila, victorious after seven months of civil war, proclaimed himself head of state. As jubilant crowds greeted the rebels after their marathon march across Africa's third largest country, ousted president Mobutu Sese Seko's rag-tag army switched sides, ditched their uniforms or fled. Mobutu, 66, who is dying of prostate cancer, yielded power Friday and left the capital for his ancestral home in the north. He is said to be going to Morocco and from there possibly to France to live in exile. Kabila, 56, renamed Zaire the Democratic Republic of Congo, reverting to the title used after independence from Belgium in 1960 and before Mobutu renamed the sprawling, mineral-rich country in 1971. Kabila, who has fought to oust Mobutu for 32 years, said he would form ""a transitional government of national salvation''  within three days, and would convene an assembly within 60 days to write a new constitution. --- CANNES, France - Canadian director Atom Egoyan won the International Critics Prize at Cannes on Saturday for his film The Sweet Hereafter.

Kim was quick to apologize for his son's alleged wrongdoing, and urged the country to put the scandal behind it and focus on other problems, such as an economic slump and relations with rival North Korea. But opposition parties vowed to reveal more corruption in the government. They claim Kim condoned his son's alleged corrupt deals with businessmen. Kim Hyun-chul, 37, the president's second son, was accused of taking about $5 million Cdn in bribes from two businessmen seeking government contracts and licences and his influence in a court case over a stock dispute. He also allegedly took about $5 million in cash from four businessmen and laundered the money to evade $2 million in taxes. Prosecutors say they do not yet have evidence that those payments were bribes. Prosecutors say he may have hidden as much as $23 million in more than 100 secret bank accounts. --- What's Ahead May 19: East Brookfield, Mass. - Trial of New Brunswick trucker Austin Kilcollins continues.

./samples/,"Last week's invasion of western Uganda by Zairean-backed rebels coincided with at least three other rebel attacks in different parts of Uganda, the official New Vision newspaper reported here Tuesday. Quoting two Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels, who recently surrendered to the government, New Vision said that LRA leader Joseph Kony met last month at his base in southern Sudan with three other rebel groups--the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), the Tabliq Moslems and the Uganda People's Army (UPA). The Tabliqs are now allied to the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU) under the umbrella of Allied Democratic Movement/Army (ADM/A), which invaded Uganda on November 13. The meeting was aimed at coordinating the timing of the invasion of Kasese district of western Uganda, which has left more than 200 people dead since it started. The LRA has been battling government troops in northern Uganda for the past 10 years in a campaign to overthrow President Yoweri Museveni's secular government and to replace it with one based on the Ten Commandments. In September, 400 of its fighters entered the country from Sudan apparently to reinforce those already involved in major guerrilla warfare inside the country. The WNBF, led by former dictator Idi Amin's foreign minister Juma Oris, also entered Uganda from Sudan through Zaire, as well as maintaining pressure on Ugandan forces inside the country. But the UPA, led by former president Milton Obote's minister of state for defence Peter Otai and once active in eastern Uganda, had stopped operating several years ago. Despite claims by the Ugandan government that the ADA threat was now over, the independent Crusader newspaper reported Tuesday that a group of ADA fighters secured the border trading centres of Mpondwe and Bwera and infiltrated Bushenyi district further south. Ugandan troops regained Bwera on Saturday and retook the Mpondwe border post on Sunday, but fighting was said to be still going on in the area, with press here reporting fighting Monday at Kiburara, 28 kilometres (17 miles) from Kasese town, the regional capital. The rebels were also reported to be in control of Kinyansi, seven kilometres (nearly four miles) from Bwera. As a result of the fighting, the Monitor newspaper said, there were some 70,000 registered refugees in Kasese district, with an estimated 30,000 others believed to be staying with relatives. Although the Ugandan government has persistently said that the rebel ADA was backed by Zairean armed forces, there have been no reports of Zaireans being taken prisoner in the ongoing fighting, nor have journalists, quoting witnesses, reported any sightings of Zairean soldiers inside Uganda. But in a statement faxed to the Ugandan press on Monday, ADA's general secretary Sentamu Kayiira disclosed for the first time that the plot to invade Uganda was hatched outside the Ugandan capital Kampala, but denied that the movement had its bases in Zaire. It also dissociated itself from the NALU rebel group, whose fighters the government and witnesses said to be among the invading force. Kayiira said in his statement that ADA was fighting to remove the Ugandan president, whom he referred to as a ""Rwandese Tutsi,"" and claimed that the May 9 presidential election results in which Museveni scored three-quarters of the vote were rigged. Meanwhile, another rebel group, the National Democratic Alliance led by Major Herbert Itongwa, has claimed responsibility for the September 13 attack on Seeta police post in central Uganda's Mukono district in which one police officer was killed. However, two other rebel groups, the Uganda Federal Democratic Front and the Ninth October Movement, have since also claimed responsibility. anb/lto/gd/gk AFP","""1996-11-19T00:00:00Z""","""3TDD-TNN0-0031-V4N2-00000-00"""
./samples/,"Abandoned by some of his best foreign friends, offered a humiliating out by a longtime foe, Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko turned Thursday to the one compatriot who has always been there for him: the military. His new prime minister wore a four-star general's uniform on his first day on the job, underscoring his commitment to ""restoring order"" to the war-racked land. Rebel leader Laurent Kabila stopped his advancing forces to give Mobutu time to mull over a three-day ultimatum to step down. But he made clear that rebels will march on the capital - the president's last stronghold - if the answer is no. Two of Mobutu's once loyal foreign backers, Belgium and the United States, intensified pressure on him to resign. His former allies were outraged when Mobutu cronies - including his son - blocked opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi from taking his seat as prime minister on Wednesday. ""Mobutuism has no future, and now we have to see how to get to a transitional government,"" Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said in Brussels. The White House called Thursday for rebel-government negotiations on ""interim arrangements for new constitutional authority in Zaire,"" McCurry said. Mobutu, ailing and having lost more than a third of his country to the rebels, had succumbed last week to domestic and international pressure to name Tshisekedi as prime minister. Tshisekedi promised to overhaul corruption and work toward elections, but the experiment in democracy didn't last long. After two days of pro-Tshisekedi rallies, Mobutu cracked down on activists, declared a state of emergency and appointed an old army buddy, Likulia Bolongo, prime minister. A senior aide to Tshisekedi promised further resistance, and said the Tshisekedi administration - which considers itself Zaire's legitimate government - would seek to try Mobutu for high treason. Joseph Yaone said Tshisekedi's path would continue to be non-violent. ""We don't have to prove ourselves against barbarians,"" he said. Leaving little doubt about the new government's direction, Likulia wore his general's uniform and was saluted by his guards as he left his luxurious Kinshasa home for his first meeting with Mobutu as premier. Likulia's convoy arrived at Mobutu's heavily guarded palace, overlooking the rapids of the Zaire River, just as a bugle call marked the noon hour. The pomp and circumstance recalled Mobutu's good old days, immortalized on ministry building walls where yellowing photographs show the uniformed dictator receiving American and European dignitaries. When Mobutu assumed power in 1965, the United States and Zaire's former colonial masters in Belgium saw the eager and capable young colonel as the key to stabilizing Zaire and thwarting Soviet expansion in the region. But the friendship faded with the end of the Cold War and Mobutu's alleged tendency to keep mining revenues from Zaire's mineral-rich land for himself. Mobutu clearly has been stung by the perceived abandonment. ""I'm not propped up by certain embassies,"" he said during a rare public appearance last week. ""I don't depend on them."" One senior officer shouted at a reporter leaving Likulia's first press conference: ""The United States treats its friends like Kleenex!"" The Belgian and U.S. ambassadors met with Likulia on Thursday. ""I think that this country needs, very badly, change,"" U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson said after the meeting. ""What you need is responsible elected government."" Simpson said Mobutu did not necessarily have to step down to effect change. But the Belgians - with a large expatriate community and extensive business interests in Zaire - hope that change will come with Kabila. ""Kabila is clear: He wants a transitional period and then democratic elections,"" said Derycke, the Belgian foreign minister. Kabila on Thursday welcomed the U.S. distancing from Mobutu. ""Everybody knows that this is the time for Mr. Mobutu to get out of power,"" Kabila said. In the southeast, fighting continued Thursday on the outskirts of Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city. U.N. staff reported gunfire and explosions in the general direction of the Lubumbashi airport, spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt said in New York. The rebels, meanwhile, said they were approaching Kinshasa and called on foreign nationals to evacuate the capital, according to a radio report monitored in nearby Gabon. Diplomats in Kinshasa said they had heard of the warning, but were not taking it seriously. Some 1,300 Marines and other U.S. forces near Zaire were at ""a very high state of awareness and preparedness"" in the event an evacuation of Americans is ordered, Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday said in Washington. Thabo Mbeki, the South African deputy president, indicated Thursday that South Africa may be willing to give Mobutu asylum.

./samples/,"Zaire's veteran rival leaders have agreed to their first face-to-face talks as the United States piled on the pressure for a ceasefire and a new deal for Zaireans eager for democratic change. US envoy Bill Richardson said after talks with President Mobutu Sese Seko on Tuesday that the country's ailing ruler was willing to meet rebel leader Laurent Kabila immediately. South African foreign ministry spokesman Pieter Swanepoel later said Kabila and Mobutu would meet on board the South African naval vessel SAS Outeniqua. The 21,000-tonne icebreaker and combat support ship had left Simonstown port last week for waters off Zaire, diplomatic sources said. said. The actual date for the talks has yet to be announced but South African presidential spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe said the meeting could take place later this week. Richardson said earlier that ""this weekend would be an important goal."" Swanepoel said South African officials did not want to comment on the substance of the talks which are reportedly being held to negotiate Mobutu's retirement from power after three decades. Netshitenzhe said South African President Nelson Mandela, 78 hwho has led diplomatic efforts to end the six-month-old conflict in Zaire, was ""very excited"" that Mobutu and Kabila had agreed to meet. Mandela's deputy, Thabo Mbeki who mediated talks between Zaire's warring sides in Pretoria last month, will attend the meeting, officials said. Richardson met Tuesday with Kabila in the country's second city Lubumbashi. He said he had argued for a ceasefire, three-way talks also including the political opposition led by Etienne Tshisekedi and the formation of a transitional government. He said he would return Wednesday to Kinshasa for further talks with Mobutu. Richardson refused to comment on whether Mobutu was preparing to step down. The United States has been pressing both sides to get down to talks and had reportedly grown impatient with Kabila's refusal to meet Mobutu until the latter agreed to resign. Washington is hoping to boost its stature in Africa by its action in Zaire, but its efforts to stop the bloodshed are riddled with uncertainties, analysts say. With nine countries on its border and the second largest land mass in Africa, Zaire's fate is closely linked to that of the entire continent, where the United States has growing trade and investment interests. By dispatching Richardson to the region, Washington hopes to put Zaire firmly on the path towards stability with a transitional government, although its precise form has yet to be determined. ""Clearly, this is the end game,"" says Ernest Wilson, a former analyst on Africa at the National Security Council who now heads the Center for International Development and Conflict Management. In Washington's view, the final struggle involves three major power-brokers: Mobutu, Kabila and Tshisekedi. Mobutu, who for the past seven years has resisted US pressure to democratize, is now being pressed to leave power, even though it remains unclear whether he may still play a role in a transitional arrangement. Kabila, whose forces currently hold more than half of Zaire, remains overall an unknown quantity to Washington. His democratic credentials remain in doubt and many Africa analysts here say he does not have the stature to handle the affairs of state. Reports of refugee massacres by members of Kabila's alliance and Kabila's announcement that he was giving UN and aid workers 60 days in which to repatriate all the refugees have also tarnished the rebel leader's reputation. Beyond the internal challenges, the United States sees international and domestic implications to the worsening conflict in Zaire. Without strong US engagement at this juncture, the conflict may spill over into other nations, opening the prospect of a military intervention in central Africa that Washington wants to avoid at all cost. The rebels claimed on Tuesday to have captured the town of Kikwit, 450 kilometres (280 miles) east of Kinsahsa, the capital's last line of defence. The fall of Kikwit would be a serious blow to Mobutu's beleaguered regime since the town lies on a strategic road junction and is a centre for food deliveries to the capital. Meanwhile efforts to bring aid to tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees in the area of Kisangani in northeastern Zaire saw some success on Tuesday as humanitarian organisations managed to push through 10 tonnes of aid for the first time in a week to refugees at Biaro camp about 40 kilometres (25 miles) south of Kisangani. bur/jb jb","""1997-04-30T00:00:00Z""","""3TD9-38C0-0025-F3JG-00000-00"""
./samples/,"By Denis Barnett KINSHASA, May 20 (AFP) - Kinshasa waited impatiently Tuesday for the arrival of Laurent Kabila, the former Marxist whose ragtag army overthrew the corrupt regime which for three decades had ruled over the country formerly known as Zaire. A thunderstorm loomed over the city, dampening speculation that Kabila's triumphant arrival was imminent. The rebel alliance's security chief, Paul Kabongo, was non-committal when asked at midday if Kabila would arrive later. ""I don't know yet,"" he said. Kabongo admitted earlier that security remained a concern in Kinshasa, capital of the vast sprawling country which Kabila has renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo, the name it assumed on gaining independence from Belgium less than 40 years ago. ago. But he said this was not the reason why Kabila's arrival had been delayed. ""It's just a question of his calendar,"" he insisted. Aides at Kabila's base of Lubumbashi, in the southeast of the country, said earlier that the new leader would go to Kinshasa sometime Tuesday. On the security situation, Kabongo stressed that ""you can't resolve everything in a few hours, you need time to set up all the security measures."" He said that some parts of Kinshasa remained dangerous, but that the alliance ""will do everything to bring order there, our order and our way of looking at things."" The capital, with a population of five million, was back to its normal bustle after the tensions and general strike which marked the final days in power of ousted president Mobutu Sese Seko, who was reported to be sheltering in Togo. Shops were open and open-air markets crowded, public transport was working and newspapers appeared on the shelves--even the traditionally pro-Mobutu Salongo. Once in Kinshasa, Kabila was expected to announce the formation of an interim government which he had earlier promised to name by Tuesday. Speaking in the new administration's headquarters in the chic surroundings of the Intercontinental Hotel, Kabongo said former prime minister Etienne Tshisekedi could play ""an important role"" in the new government. Asked if he would be prime minister, he said only: ""Every ministry will be important."" Tshisekedi has emerged as a frontrunner here to head Kabila's first government. The 64-year-old opposition leader has been a minister several times before splitting with Mobutu in the 1980s and founding a non-violent opposition party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress. As recently as last month he was appointed to succeed sacked prime minister Kengo Wa Dondo but was forced to stand down almost immediately. He was understood to be holding talks with the alliance secretary general Deogratias Bugera at the hotel, but this could not be immediately confirmed. A senior policy advisor to Bugera, Jean-Baptiste Mulemba Makube, said several committees set up by the alliance, including those responsible for judicial and economic matters, were holding talks in the hotel with interested parties. The lobby of the hotel was awash with besuited delegations jostling for the new administration's favour on Tuesday. On Monday Bugera invited ""all those with ideas"" to rally to the alliance and construct a society where state power came from the people and remained in their hands. Kabongo, who is likely to be named security minister in the new government, said the alliance was in total control of the country after seven months of civil war. ""We have put an end to Mobutu's regime in this country. All his supporters have fled."" He added that even if isolated pockets of resistance were discovered, they would quickly be eradicated. For the moment, however, the vast sweep of the Congo river between Kinshasa and the Congolese capital Brazzaville remained closed, and was unlikely to be reopened until after Kabila's visit. The airport remained closed to international traffic and Kabongo's aides said the port could remain closed until Monday. db/bb President Laurent Kabila delayed a trip to Kinshasa Tuesday to announce the formation of a transitional government because the capital of the former Zaire was still not 100 percent secure, reliable sources said. The alliance official in charge of security, Paul Kabongo, acknowledged in Kinshasa Tuesday that pockets of insecurity remained, saying: ""you can't solve all problems in a few hours and you need time to perfect all security measures."" Kabila proclaimed himself president on Saturday after his troops entered Kinshasa and president Mobutu Sese Seko fled. Kabila announced then that he would form a government of national unity within 72 hours, and governments around the world rushed to recognise him as head of state, and to acknowledge the new name for the country following the defeat of Mobutu's forces by Kabila's rebel army.

The official in charge of security, Paul Kabongo, acknowledged in Kinshasa that pockets of insecurity remained, saying: ""You can't solve all problems in a few hours and you need time to perfect all security measures."" Kabila proclaimed himself president on Saturday after his troops entered Kinshasa and Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko fled along with his leading associates and family members. Kabila announced then that he would form a government of national unity within 72 hours, and governments around the world rushed to recognise him as head of state and to acknowledge the Democratic Republic of Congo, the new name for Zaire, following the defeat of Mobutu's forces by Kabila's rebel army.

They were to join a delegation headed by the alliance's secretary general, Deogratias Bugera, which is already in the capital. No officials here were prepared to say when Kabila would make the trip. Mawampanga told reporters before leaving that the new government would exclude Mobutu supporters. ""It will not include political parties,"" he said, with all members of the new government being chosen as individuals. No word of the composition of the government had leaked out by Tuesday evening, with Mawampanga maintaining that he did not know whether he would become finance minister. ""There is a lot of work to do,"" he said. ""It is not a time to fracture the country at this junction of history. We all need to come together to rebuild the country."" But Mawampanga said political parties would ""definitely"" be allowed to contest upcoming elections, which he said would be held ""within 12 months.""

./samples/,"The hopes among some Western Governments and many Zairians that when President Mobutu Sese Seko left here on Tuesday, he would not return, were crumbling today. ""This one is 50-50,"" a Western diplomat here said about the possibility of Mr. Mobutu's returning home on Friday as he had said he would. Mr. Mobutu's return would substantially reduce the prospects for a peaceful settlement of the civil war, and increase the possibility of serious bloodshed if the rebels take Kinshasa by force, Western officials say. Tonight the leaders of six French-speaking African countries, including Mr. Mobutu, who are meeting in neighboring Gabon, issued a statement saying that he would ask Zaire's transitional Parliament to elect a leader who would assume power if Mr. Mobutu stepped down. A senior Western diplomat dismissed the move as ""too little too late,"" and said that there was no reason for the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, to accept it. The communique did not say whether Mr. Mobutu would return to Zaire. But, asked today if he was returning home, he responded, ""why shouldn't I?"" Reuters reported. In spite of public statements intended to cover up their differences, the United States and France remain divided on how to deal with the Zairian crisis. Washington wants France to press Mr. Mobutu to stay out of the country. France wants the United States to put more pressure on Mr. Kabila to halt his military advances and negotiate with Mr. Mobutu. Contrary to earlier reports, Mr. Kabila has not promised American officials that he will halt his advance, Western officials said today. Heavy fighting continued near Kenge, 120 miles east of Kinshasa. The resistance is the stiffest that the rebels, now reinforced by Angolan troops, have met, but Western military analysts say that the rebels are on an inevitable march to the capital and may enter in four or five days. The International Committee of the Red Cross said today that as many as 200 civilians had been killed in Kenge, including some of their medical workers, the Associated Press reported. Adding to the confusion were conflicting views on whether Mr. Mobutu and Mr. Kabila would negotiate face-to-face. President Clinton's special envoy, Bill Richardson, the United States representative to the United Nations, said today that he thought the probability was ""high."" ""I'm also encouraged that this second meeting will produce a result that does not involve a violent end, and that includes also an inclusive transitional government,"" he said. He spent the day in Paris meeting with French officials in what a Western diplomat called an effort to ""smooth over any bruised feelings."" Mr. Richardson had planned to meet with President Jacques Chirac and Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, but they were not available. Mr. Richardson insisted that this was not a snub. Officials from South Africa, which has been the other major power in the diplomatic struggle to end the war, also expressed confidence that Mr. Mobutu and Mr. Kabila would meet. But a Western diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he would bet against such a meeting and described Mr. Mobutu's and Mr. Kabila's positions as ""irreconcilable. Mr. Kabila wants Mr. Mobutu to hand over power to his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo. Mr. Mobutu has said that he would only be willing to form a transition government that would lead to elections. As for Mr. Mobutu's more immediate future--whether or not he returns to his capital on Friday--that depends largely on the French and what he heard from other heads of state at the hastily-called summit meeting in Libreville, Gabon. Western officials said they thought it was questionable whether these other African leaders would press Mr. Mobutu to go into exile, lest they face similar pressure in the future. The French hold the most leverage over Mr. Mobutu, Western officials say. While the United States helped Mr. Mobutu come to power in 1965, and Mr. Mobutu was a loyal ally for years, American influence has waned. The most graceful exit for Mr. Mobutu would be to go to France for medical treatment, Western diplomats say.

Annan said the United Nations, in close cooperation with the countries of the region, is hoping to persuade the warring parties to form a coalition government of all forces involved in the conflict. ''We have not given up hope of getting the parties to accept some sort of a transitional arrangement and therefore avoid bloody conflict in the capital city,''  Annan said at a news conference in Moscow.

./samples/,"Beset by cancer and rebel attacks, Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko has agreed to long-delayed elections in his country and acknowledged he is too ill to be a candidate. Still, the man rebels claim has looted Zaire for nearly 32 years clung to his presidency. Mobutu insisted he would return today to Kinshasa, the Zairian capital, but by nightfall he had still not left and diplomats said he would remain for another night. Diplomats are pushing for a peace settlement between Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent Kabila, whose forces have been clashing this week in Kenge, 115 miles east of Kinshasa. Aid agencies say 300 people have been killed in the fighting. ""The next few days are critical for peace in Zaire,"" U.S. envoy Bill Richardson said in Paris after briefing French diplomats on his nine-day shuttle diplomacy mission in Zaire. Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, refused to say whether Mobutu would go into exile, but he came close to acknowledging that the 66-year-old dictator's reign was coming to an end. ""The ultimate solution will involve a transitional government - there's going to be a change in Zaire,"" Richardson said. South African deputy president Thabo Mbeki met with Kabila today in the southern city of Lubumbashi, and said the rebel leader and Mobutu would meet again Wednesday on a South African navy ship. But a rebel spokesman, Bizima Karaha, said Kabila would come only to receive a direct transfer of power, and rejected a proposal that Mobutu turn power over to a transitional figure. ""We are not fighting Mobutu. We are fighting a system, and in that parliament there are people who are part of that system,"" Karaha said. ""It's just a maneuver."" In Kinshasa, several hundred Mobutu supporters protested today in front of the U.S. Embassy. Zaire has accused the United States of joining Uganda and Rwanda in supporting Kabila. Waving placards saying, ""We don't want a bloodbath in our dear capital,"" the demonstrators called for negotiations with the rebels who have captured three-quarters of the Central African nation. At a summit in Gabon on Thursday, African leaders called on the Zairian armed forces to prepare for new elections and said Mobutu was too ill to run. The statement was signed by Mobutu and the presidents of Gabon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, the Central African Republic and Chad, and the foreign minister of Cameroon. It made no mention of Mobutu resigning. Since promising a transition to democracy in 1990, Mobutu has repeatedly postponed the country's first multiparty elections. But with mounting international pressure and the rebels closing in on the capital, he has recently repeated his promise. While others have speculated that the Gabon trip was a way to get Mobutu out of the country permanently, the Zairian president has steadfastly denied that. Nonetheless, some high-ranking Zairian military officers close to Mobutu have already left the country or sent their families out, apparently fearing Mobutu's imminent fall.","""1997-05-09T00:00:00Z""","""3T8G-8900-000Y-K39X-00000-00"""

''We think a period of three years will be enough to achieve the program we have set ourselves,''  Pierre Buyoya said in a broadcast Wednesday night. Buyoya, a retired major who was named president by the army in a July 25 coup, urged Burundians to support his program ''at this serious point in our history.''  Ousted President Syvestre Ntibantungaya, a Hutu, remains holed up at the resident of U.S. Ambassador Morris Hughes. Buyoya said he plans to include legislators from the previous National Assembly in a proposed transitional parliament. He gave no details. On April 6, Buyoya said the transitional national assembly ''would include representatives from all walks of society.''  In additional to the powers the previous assembly had, the new parliament ''will also play a determining role in the national debate and the attempts at national reconciliation.''  Buyoya repeated his earlier pledge to improve discipline in the military. ''We are to reinforce discipline, strictness and professional ethics among all the forces charged with maintaining law and order,''  Buyoya said. The Tutsi-dominated military has been accused of killing Hutu civilians in retaliation for attacks by Hutu rebels. The Hutu extremists have also been blamed for killing Tutsi civilians, especially those displaced from their homes by the fighting and living in camps. Hutus make up 84 percent of the country's population and Tutsis 14 percent. The Twa make up the rest. Buyoya has defended his taking power, saying he will stop the violence in which more than 500,000 people have been slain since the 1993 assassination of the country's first Hutu leader, Melchior Ndadaye, in a failed military coup. Buyoya spoke only hours after state radio reported that the prices of food and transport fares were rising due to the economic sanctions imposed by regional leaders. Borders with Zaire, Rwanda and Tanzania have been closed and Zambia, whose ports on Lake Tanganyika Burundi can use, says it will not permit sanctions busting. Tanzania's Indian Ocean port of Dar es Salaam handles 80 percent of Burundi's imports and exports and Mombasa in Kenya the remaining 20 percent.

''Repatriation does not take place if there is no peace,''  said Yusuf Hassan, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Johannesburg. ''We do not repatriate people in the early stages of peace.''  He said Angola had reached the point when soldiers would be quartered in camps and demobilized, which he called the litmus test for peace. A U.N. peacekeeping force of more than 6,000 soldiers is assembling in Angola to provide security under a peace agreement signed last year by the government and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels to end almost 20 years of civil war. There are about 200,000 Angolan refugees in Zaire, 96,000 in Zambia, 12,000 in Congo and 1,000 in Namibia, with another 15,000 scattered among 32 other countries. ------ KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) A Burundian judge will visit Uganda to question soldiers who fled Burundi after a failed October 1993 coup attempt in which the country's first elected Hutu president was assassinated. Diplomatic sources said the decision was reached in talks between President Yoweri Museveni and Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo of Burundi, who visited Uganda on Tuesday. Eight Tutsi soldiers implicated in President Melchior Ndadaye's slaying in October 1993 fled to Uganda and were detained by the military. But two of them have since been freed by the High Court and are believed to be living in eastern Zaire. Ndadaye's slaying triggered an ethnic bloodbath pitting majority Hutus against the Tutsi minority. At least 100,000 people have been killed in the continuing violence. Some Burundian and foreign governments say the cycle of violence in the tiny Central African nation will continue as long as the coup plotters remain unpunished. ------ NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) President Daniel arap Moi has warned Somali factions against squabbling in Kenya and advised them to inform authorities whenever they plan a meeting. Moi was speaking to Somalis in Nairobi on Thursday. Among them was Osman Hassan Ato, who was held by police with about a dozen supporters for 18 hours Tuesday. Ato said he was detained after someone told police he was meeting Kenyan opposition figures. Kenya has a sizeable ethnic Somali population in the semi-arid eastern region bordering Somalia. Ato is a former financier and right hand man of Gen. Mohamed Farrah Aidid, whom he replaced as leader of the Somali National Alliance last month. ------ HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) Racing driver Satwant Singh of Zambia, found guilty of negligent driving that killed a man, will be sentenced Aug. 8, court officials said. Singh, a former rally champion known as ''The Flying Sikh,''  faces a fine or imprisonment over the death of engineer John Pitt during last year's Zimbabwe Challenge rally. Harare magistrate Cosmas Mukwesha ruled Singh was negligent and driving at excessive speed in Harare when his car went through an intersection controlled by traffic lights and collided with Pitt's car. Mukwesha said state prosecutors failed to prove their contention Singh drove through a red light, but ruled he failed to take evasive action when the accident was imminent. At the time, Singh was not competing against the clock, but was driving through downtown Harare between stages of the race. He and navigator Richard Leeke, driving a Toyota Celica, received minor injuries and abandoned the rally. ------ BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) The ruling party has formalized its coalition with the smaller Alliance for Democracy party eight months after AFORD leader Chakufwa Chihana joined the government. An agreement signed by Chihana at President Bakili Muluzi's Sanjika Palace in Blantyre set the stage for a minor Cabinet reshuffle by guaranteeing AFORD three ministerial posts to every seven held by Muluzi's United Democratic Front. At present, AFORD has seven ministers instead of nine required by the accord. Chihana was appointed second vice president in November in a bid to unify Malawi's fledgling democratic movement after elections in May that ended the 30-year dictatorship of Kamuzu Banda. Chihana's party won 37 parliamentary seats to 87 by Muluzi's party and 53 by Banda's Malawi Congress party. ''This agreement will be the foundation of our future,''  said Chihana, a popular labor leader whose arrest in 1992 after returning from exile set off a series of opposition protests and a Western aid freeze that led to Banda's downfall. ------ ACCRA, Ghana (AP) A two-day summit for heads of states of the Economic Community of West Africa opened Friday in the Ghanaian capital. The theme for this year's gathering, the 18th since the regional body was formed in 1975, is economic integration, which is sorely lacking in the region. Heads of states and other dignitaries began to arrive late Thursday, including the presidents of Ivory Coast, Benin, Guinea and Niger. Notably absent were military leaders Gen.

West Africa suffers from a lack of regional cooperation, civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone, rebel conflicts in many of the member nations and struggling economies made worse by the devaluation of the West African currency in January 1994. ------ MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) Liberia's ruling transitional government has launched a national fund-raising drive to help pay for its peace process. The government said the so-called peace fund would be run by a 23-member committee of businessmen, bankers, ethnic chiefs and religious and student leaders. ''This is a strategy to give hope to the combatants that they have a future in Liberia after disarmament,''  said David Kpomakpor, chairman of the five-member collective presidency. He said he hoped the fund-raising drive would ''signal to the donor community and international aid agencies operating in the country that Liberians are now assuming the responsibility for peace.''  Kpomakpor said the fund would help finance the disarming of the 60,000 rebels who have been battling one another for control of the West African country for nearly six years. The war has killed an estimated 150,000 people and displaced nearly half of the country's 2.6 million people. (var-tsc) Four small foot bones found last year among discarded fossils bolster the belief that man's evolution from apes included a phase as a walking, climbing creature, two South African scientists said Friday. The discovery by Ronald Clarke and Phillip Tobias of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg adds new evidence to a longstanding debate over how the human race developed. Tobias and Clarke, at a news conference complete with fossil bones and plaster casts of human and ape feet, said their find proved an ape-man known as Australopithecus had human and ape-like features. In particular, they said the foot bones discovered by Clarke last year in bags of discarded fossils from the Sterkfontein caves northwest of Johannesburg showed the ape-man from an estimated 3.5 million years ago could walk upright like man but had an ape-like big toe capable of grasping and more movement than a human big toe. ''The ankle bone was perfectly human,''  Tobias said. ''But as we traveled toward the big toe, more and more chimpanzee features appeared.''  An article on the find by Tobias and Clarke appeared in Friday's edition of Science, the authoritative weekly journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington. Two major bodies of thought comprise the debate over human development. One of those, supported by Tobias and Clarke, says ape-men gradually changed from four-legged creatures who lived in trees to two-legged ones that walked upright but still retained ape-like features allowing them to grasp tree branches with their feet. Another, espoused by Dr. Owen Lovejoy of Kent State University in the United States and others, says humans always walked upright and were plains dwellers who never lived in trees. Lovejoy, in an accompanying article in Science magazine Friday, said Tobias and Clarke ignored other research that indicated ape-men walked upright, according to bone structure of their hips and spine. Basing such a major theory on four foot bones was ''mechanically and developmentally naive,''  he wrote. But Tobias said an unassailable body of evidence now existed supporting his and Clarke's position. Other findings showed the ape-man's knee and shoulders retained features of a climber, he noted. ''Australopithecus was far more ape-like in many of its features than we'd ever dared imagine previously,''  he said. It was unclear which species of Australopithecus the four foot bones, from the same left foot, belonged to, Tobias said. Two species, determined by teeth and other features, have been found in South Africa, while at least two others were discovered in east Africa in the famous finds of Tanzania and Ethiopia by Louis and Mary Leakey and others. How Clarke discovered the fossils also was a bit inexact. The stones that contained the new find were from a deep layer at Sterkfontein caves estimated to be 3.5 million years old. In the 1920s, part of the layer was blasted out and the refuse rock was left lying underground. Eventually it was collected and brought to the surface, but processing failed to turn up the four foot bones. Last year, Clarke was perusing some bags of the discarded fossils for evidence of animal life from the early era. Instead, he spotted a decidedly human-like ankle bone. ''I said out loud, 'Wait a minute, this isn't a carnivore, this is a hominid,'""he recalled Friday. ''I was astounded.''  Clarke immediately knew he had evidence of the earliest hominid, or human ancestor, found in South Africa. Further research with Tobias, who was teaching at the University of Pennsylvania at the time, revealed the ape-like features of the bones and joints they formed. They called the find the most significant regarding human development in decades and further proof that humankind originated in Africa. Hominid fossils in Africa are older than those found anywhere else, and the theory is that early man migrated to the rest of the world from the continent. ''All humankind, of whatever race, shares...the same ancestors,''  Tobias said. ''We share a common African ancestry.''  (tsc) Four soldiers were killed and two others seriously injured when their helicopter crashed in central South Korea, a report said. The UH-1H helicopter appeared to be on a routine training mission when it crashed around 12:30 p.m. (0330 GMT) near Eumsong, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Seoul, the national news agency Yonhap reported. The South Korean army helicopter crashed into a fence by a house on a farm, but there were no injuries to people on the ground, it said. The cause of the accident was not immediately known. Lt. Col. Kim Se-kwon and two other officers were killed on the spot and an enlisted man died later at a hospital, Yonhap said. South Africa complained Friday that European Union delays on cutting agricultural tariffs were hurting South African farmers and setting a bad precedent for upcoming trade talks. Neil van Heerden, South Africa's ambassador to the EU, blamed southern European nations in particular for holding up proposals for tariffs cuts on a range of South African farm products. ''It does not auger well for the negotiations that are to come,''  he said in a telephone interview. The proposals, drafted by the EU's executive Commission, aim to extend the EU's ''Generalized Scheme of Preferences''  to a wider range of South African farm products. South Africa was already smarting because the proposals fall short of trade preferences the 15-nation Union grants farmers from competing nations such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. Van Heerden said many of South Africa's most competitive products will remain excluded. Apricots, for example, will continue to be subject to a 22 percent tariff, table grapes 18 percent, he said. Those benefits South African farmers might have gained from the tariff cuts have been ''substantially eroded''  by the failure to get it approved by the 15 Union governments before the EU's summer break, the South African embassy said in a statement. Van Heerden blamed EU stalling on ''misconceptions''  that cheap South African fruit, vegetables and other products would undercut southern European producers. ''It would deliver quality products to the European consumer in the off-season,''  he said. ''Everybody benefits.''  Van Heerden said South Africa would lobby vigorously to ensure approve for the trade terms when EU foreign ministers next meet Oct. 2. Stressing its will to support South African democracy, the EU is scheduled to start formal talks Sept. 11 in Pretoria on a agreement to lower trade barriers in wide range of sectors and deepen political and economic cooperation.

./samples/,"Zaire's embattled, ailing president met face-to-face Sunday with the rival who has overrun nearly three-fourths of his country but all they agreed on was to hold another meeting. President Mobutu Sese Seko did not announce his resignation, as had been predicted by diplomats aboard the South African naval vessel where the talks were held. Mediators thought the peace talks between the bitter rivals was the last chance to secure a truce and prevent the rebels from marching on Zaire's capital, Kinshasa. All indications were that the rebels had every intention of advancing toward their final goal. U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun said Mobutu had proposed a cease-fire and the creation of a transitional government that would prepare the Central African nation for its first multiparty elections. Mobutu said he would hand over power to such an elected authority. But rebel leader Laurent Kabila, according to a statement read by Sahnoun, demands that the rebel alliance take power as the transitional authority and says Mobutu should cede power to them. During a news conference with a grim Mobutu and a smiling Kabila, Sahnoun told reporters aboard the naval ship docked in the port city of Pointe Noire that South African President Nelson Mandela, who was helping mediate the talks, would convene another meeting in six to 10 days to narrow the gap between them. ''Perhaps at the start, it's normal, there was some tension from both sides,''  Sahnoun said. ''But then there was a cordial tone, very African. There were no poisonous remarks.''  Kabila said Friday he would go to the talks only to secure ''Mobutu's exit and the handover of power to the alliance.''  Otherwise, he said, rebel forces would take the rest of Zaire within two weeks. Mobutu has insisted that he will never bow to Kabila's demand to resign, but his prostate cancer and international pressure may yet force him to do so. Sources close to the talks had said that mediators were seeking an agreement in which Mobutu would step down for health reasons and appoint an interim president until elections could be held. This would allow Kabila and his forces to peacefully enter Kinshasa. Mobutu left the ship without speaking to reporters and was expected to fly back to Kinshasa later in the day. Kabila flew back to Angola, where the government has been accused by Zaire and Western powers of aiding the rebels with troops and equipment. The Portuguese news agency LUSA said Kabila arrived in the capital Luanda at about 7:15 p.m. local time (1815 GMT) but did not make any statements to reporters. The agency said he was on his way to meet with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Sahnoun said, 12th graf pvs (bdb)","""1997-05-04T00:00:00Z""","""3RY4-5FY0-00BT-M42V-00000-00"""
